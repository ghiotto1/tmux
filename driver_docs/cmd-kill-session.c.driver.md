# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and defines the functionality for the "kill-session" command. The primary purpose of this code is to provide the implementation for destroying a tmux session, which involves detaching all clients connected to the session and removing any windows that are exclusively linked to it. The code is structured around a command entry definition, `cmd_kill_session_entry`, which specifies the command's name, potential arguments, usage, and the execution function [`cmd_kill_session_exec`](#cmd_kill_session_exec). This function handles the logic for terminating sessions based on the provided arguments, such as clearing alert flags from windows or destroying all sessions except the target one.

The file is not a standalone executable but rather a component of the larger tmux application, intended to be compiled and linked with other parts of the tmux codebase. It does not define a public API or external interface but instead contributes to the internal command handling mechanism of tmux. The code is designed to be robust, with specific checks and operations to ensure that sessions are terminated correctly, reflecting the critical nature of session management within the tmux environment. The absence of an alias for the "kill-session" command underscores the importance of preventing accidental invocation, highlighting the potentially disruptive nature of this operation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_kill_session_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_kill_session_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'kill-session' in the tmux application. It specifies the command's name, arguments, usage, target, flags, and the function to execute the command. This structure is used to manage and execute the 'kill-session' command, which destroys a session, detaching all clients and destroying any windows linked only to that session.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'kill-session' command within the tmux application.


# Functions

---
### cmd_kill_session_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_kill_session_exec}} -->
The `cmd_kill_session_exec` function handles the execution of the 'kill-session' command, which can either clear alerts from a session, destroy all sessions except the target, or destroy the target session itself.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item, which contains the target session information.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments using `cmd_get_args(self)` and the target session using `cmdq_get_target(item)`.
    - Check if the 'C' flag is present in the arguments using `args_has(args, 'C')`.
    - If the 'C' flag is present, iterate over all window links in the session, clear alert flags, and redraw the session using `server_redraw_session(s)`.
    - If the 'a' flag is present, iterate over all sessions using `RB_FOREACH_SAFE`, and destroy all sessions except the target session using [`server_destroy_session`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_destroy_session) and [`session_destroy`](session.c.driver.md#session_destroy).
    - If neither 'C' nor 'a' flags are present, destroy the target session using [`server_destroy_session`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_destroy_session) and [`session_destroy`](session.c.driver.md#session_destroy).
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate normal command execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating successful execution of the command.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args)
    - [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target)
    - [`args_has`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_has)
    - [`server_redraw_session`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_redraw_session)
    - [`server_destroy_session`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_destroy_session)
