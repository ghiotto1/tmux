# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux project, a terminal multiplexer, and it defines functionality for server control commands within tmux. Specifically, it provides the implementation for two commands: "kill-server" and "start-server". The "kill-server" command is designed to terminate the tmux server process by sending a SIGTERM signal to the current process, effectively shutting down the server. The "start-server" command, although defined here, uses the same execution function as "kill-server", indicating that its primary role is to ensure the server is running, but the actual implementation for starting the server might be handled elsewhere in the codebase.

The file defines two command entries, `cmd_kill_server_entry` and `cmd_start_server_entry`, which are structures that encapsulate the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, flags, and the function to execute the command. The [`cmd_kill_server_exec`](#cmd_kill_server_exec) function is the core execution function for these commands, and it checks which command entry is being executed to determine the appropriate action. This file is a part of a larger system and is intended to be integrated with other components of tmux, providing a narrow but essential functionality for server lifecycle management. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather contributes to the internal command handling mechanism of tmux.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `sys/types.h`
- `signal.h`
- `unistd.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_kill_server_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_kill_server_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'kill-server'. It specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, flags, and the function to execute when the command is invoked. This structure is used to register and handle the 'kill-server' command within the application.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'kill-server' command, which terminates the server process when invoked.


---
### cmd_start_server_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_start_server_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command entry for starting a server in the application. It includes fields such as the command name, alias, arguments, usage, flags, and the execution function associated with the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and register the 'start-server' command, allowing the application to recognize and execute this command when invoked.


# Functions

---
### cmd_kill_server_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_kill_server_exec}} -->
The `cmd_kill_server_exec` function terminates the server process if the command entry matches `cmd_kill_server_entry`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a `struct cmd` representing the command to be executed.
    - `item`: An unused pointer to a `struct cmdq_item`, which is part of the command queue.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the command entry associated with `self` is `cmd_kill_server_entry`.
    - If the condition is true, call `kill` with the current process ID and `SIGTERM` to terminate the process.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` indicating normal command execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval`, specifically `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating the command executed normally.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_kill_server_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_kill_server_exec}} -->
Terminates the server process.
- **Description**: This function is used to terminate the server process when invoked. It should be called when the server needs to be stopped immediately. The function checks if the command entry associated with the provided command structure is the 'kill-server' command, and if so, it sends a SIGTERM signal to the current process, effectively terminating the server. This function must be used with caution as it will stop the server without any further actions or confirmations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a 'struct cmd' representing the command to be executed. It must not be null and should be properly initialized to represent a valid command entry.
    - `item`: A pointer to a 'struct cmdq_item', which is unused in this function. It can be null or any value, as it does not affect the function's behavior.
- **Output**: Returns CMD_RETURN_NORMAL to indicate the function executed successfully, although the server process will be terminated if the command entry matches 'kill-server'.
- **See also**: [`cmd_kill_server_exec`](#cmd_kill_server_exec)  (Implementation)
