# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux project, a terminal multiplexer, and it defines functionality for server control commands within the application. Specifically, it provides the implementation for two commands: "kill-server" and "start-server". The primary function of this file is to handle the execution of these commands, with a focus on terminating the tmux server process. The [`cmd_kill_server_exec`](#cmd_kill_server_exec) function is the core component, which sends a SIGTERM signal to the current process, effectively terminating the server when the "kill-server" command is invoked.

The file defines two command entries, `cmd_kill_server_entry` and `cmd_start_server_entry`, which are structures that describe the commands' properties, such as their names, aliases, arguments, usage, and execution functions. Both command entries utilize the same execution function, [`cmd_kill_server_exec`](#cmd_kill_server_exec), indicating that the "start-server" command is likely a placeholder or shares similar termination behavior in this context. This file is not a standalone executable but rather a component of the larger tmux codebase, intended to be integrated with other parts of the application to provide server management capabilities. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather internal command handling logic for the tmux application.

# Global Variables

---
### cmd_kill_server_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_kill_server_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'kill-server'. It specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, flags, and the function to execute when the command is invoked. This structure is used to register and handle the 'kill-server' command within the application.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'kill-server' command, which terminates the server process when invoked.


---
### cmd_start_server_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_start_server_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command entry for starting a server in the application. It specifies the command name as 'start-server' with an alias 'start', and includes arguments, usage, flags, and an execution function pointer. The execution function is set to `cmd_kill_server_exec`, which is likely a placeholder or error in the code since it is intended to kill the server.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the properties and behavior of the 'start-server' command within the application.


# Functions

---
### cmd_kill_server_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_kill_server_exec}} -->
The `cmd_kill_server_exec` function terminates the server process if the command entry matches `cmd_kill_server_entry`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a `struct cmd` representing the command to be executed.
    - `item`: An unused pointer to a `struct cmdq_item`, which is part of the command queue.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the command entry associated with `self` is `cmd_kill_server_entry`.
    - If the condition is true, call `kill` with the current process ID and `SIGTERM` to terminate the process.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` indicating normal command execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval`, specifically `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating the command executed normally.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmd_get_entry`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_entry)
