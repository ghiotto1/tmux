# Purpose
The provided code is an AWK script named `mdoc2man.awk`, which is designed to convert mdoc-formatted manual pages into man-formatted pages. This script is particularly useful for systems that utilize the mdoc macro package for writing manual pages, such as BSD systems, and need to convert these documents into the more universally recognized man format, which is widely used in Unix-like operating systems. The script processes input line by line, identifying and transforming mdoc macros into their man equivalents, ensuring that the output maintains the intended formatting and structure of the original documentation.

The script begins by initializing several variables that control the formatting and state of the conversion process. It defines functions such as `wtail()` and `add()` to assist in handling word processing and line construction. The main body of the script uses pattern matching to identify specific mdoc macros and applies the appropriate transformations. For instance, it handles macros like `.Dd`, `.Dt`, `.Sh`, and `.Nm`, converting them into their man page equivalents such as `.TH`, `.SH`, and others. The script also manages special formatting cases, such as handling lists, options, and references, ensuring that the converted man pages retain the correct semantic meaning and visual layout.

Overall, `mdoc2man.awk` is a specialized utility script that provides a narrow but essential functionality for documentation conversion. It is a standalone executable script that can be run in environments where AWK is available, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces. Instead, it serves as a command-line tool for developers and system administrators who need to convert mdoc documents to man format for compatibility and distribution purposes.
# Functions

---
### wtail
The `wtail` function constructs a string from a list of words starting from a given index and returns it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `nwords`: The total number of words in the current line being processed.
    - `words`: An array containing the words of the current line.
    - `w`: The current index in the words array, indicating the starting point for constructing the return string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an empty string `retval` to store the result.
    - Iterate over the words array starting from the current index `w` until `nwords`.
    - For each word, if `retval` is not empty, append a space to `retval`.
    - Append the current word to `retval`.
    - Increment the index `w` to move to the next word.
    - Return the constructed string `retval`.
- **Output**:
    - A string composed of words from the `words` array starting from the current index `w` to the end of the array.

### add
The `add` function appends a given string to a global variable `line`, optionally adding newline characters before it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: The string to be appended to the global variable `line`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if there are any pending newline characters to be added, indicated by the `prenl` variable.
    - For each pending newline, it appends a newline character to the `line` variable and decrements `prenl`.
    - After processing newlines, it appends the input string `str` to the `line` variable.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it modifies the global variable `line` by appending the input string to it.
