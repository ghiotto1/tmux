# Purpose
The provided code is an AWK script named `mdoc2man.awk`, which is designed to convert mdoc-formatted manual pages into man-formatted pages. This script offers a narrow functionality, specifically targeting the transformation of documentation formats used in Unix-like systems. It is not an executable or a library file but rather a utility script that processes text input to produce formatted output. The script includes various functions and pattern-matching logic to handle different mdoc macros and convert them into their man page equivalents, ensuring compatibility with different systems like GNU awk and MacOS X. The script is also equipped with a permissive license, allowing for modification and distribution.
# Functions

---
### wtail
The `wtail` function constructs a string from a list of words starting from a given index and returns it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `nwords`: A global variable representing the total number of words in the current line.
    - `words`: A global array containing the words of the current line.
    - `w`: A global variable representing the current index in the words array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an empty string `retval` to store the result.
    - Enter a while loop that continues as long as `w` is less than `nwords`.
    - If `retval` is not empty, append a space to `retval`.
    - Append the next word from the `words` array to `retval` and increment `w`.
    - Return the constructed string `retval`.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns a string composed of words from the `words` array starting from the current index `w` to the end of the array, separated by spaces.

### add
The `add` function appends a given string to a global variable `line`, optionally adding newline characters beforehand.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A string to be appended to the global variable `line`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if there are any pending newline characters to be added, indicated by the `prenl` variable.
    - For each pending newline, it appends a newline character to the `line` variable.
    - After processing newlines, it appends the input string `str` to the `line` variable.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it modifies the global variable `line` by appending the input string and any necessary newlines.
