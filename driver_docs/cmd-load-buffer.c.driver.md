# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux project, a terminal multiplexer, and it defines functionality for loading a paste buffer from a file. The code is structured around a command entry, `cmd_load_buffer_entry`, which specifies the command name "load-buffer" and its alias "loadb". This command is designed to be executed within the tmux environment, allowing users to load data from a specified file into a tmux paste buffer. The command accepts arguments that specify the buffer name and target client, and it can handle errors gracefully, providing feedback to the user if the operation fails.

The core functionality is implemented in the [`cmd_load_buffer_exec`](#cmd_load_buffer_exec) function, which sets up the necessary data structures and initiates the file reading process. The file reading is handled asynchronously, with the [`cmd_load_buffer_done`](#cmd_load_buffer_done) callback function being invoked upon completion. This function processes the file data, copying it into a new buffer and integrating it into the tmux environment. The code is modular, with clear separation between command execution and file handling, and it uses several utility functions and structures from the tmux codebase, such as `cmdq_item`, `client`, and `evbuffer`, to manage command execution and data manipulation. This file is a part of the broader tmux command handling system, providing a specific utility for managing paste buffers.

# Global Variables

---
### cmd_load_buffer_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_load_buffer_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'load-buffer' and its alias 'loadb'. It specifies the arguments, usage, flags, and the execution function associated with the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'load-buffer' command within the application, linking it to its execution logic.


# Data Structures

---
### cmd_load_buffer_data
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `client`: A pointer to a client structure, representing the client associated with the command.
    - `item`: A pointer to a cmdq_item structure, representing the command queue item associated with the command.
    - `name`: A pointer to a character array (string) representing the name of the buffer to be loaded.
- **Description**: The `cmd_load_buffer_data` structure is used to store information necessary for loading a paste buffer from a file in the context of a client-server application, such as tmux. It holds references to the client and command queue item involved in the operation, as well as the name of the buffer being loaded. This structure is utilized in the process of reading a file and setting its contents as a paste buffer, allowing for asynchronous operations and error handling.


# Functions

---
### cmd_load_buffer_done<!-- {{#callable:cmd_load_buffer_done}} -->
The `cmd_load_buffer_done` function handles the completion of loading a buffer from a file, processing the data, and updating the client state if necessary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c`: A pointer to a client structure, marked as unused in this function.
    - `path`: A constant character pointer representing the file path from which the buffer was loaded.
    - `error`: An integer indicating if there was an error during the file read operation.
    - `closed`: An integer flag indicating whether the file read operation has completed.
    - `buffer`: A pointer to an evbuffer structure containing the data read from the file.
    - `data`: A void pointer to additional data, specifically a `cmd_load_buffer_data` structure in this context.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the file read operation is closed; if not, return immediately.
    - If there is an error, log the error message using `cmdq_error`.
    - If there is no error and the buffer size is non-zero, allocate memory and copy the buffer data.
    - Attempt to set the paste buffer with the copied data; if it fails, log the error and free allocated resources.
    - If the client is valid and not dead, update the client's selection with the new buffer data.
    - Unreference the client if it was used.
    - Continue processing the command queue item.
    - Free the dynamically allocated `name` and `cmd_load_buffer_data` structure.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it performs operations based on the buffer data and updates the client state or logs errors as necessary.


---
### cmd_load_buffer_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_load_buffer_exec}} -->
The `cmd_load_buffer_exec` function initiates the process of loading a paste buffer from a file, handling client references and buffer naming.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve command arguments using `cmd_get_args` and store them in `args`.
    - Get the target client from the command queue item using `cmdq_get_target_client` and store it in `tc`.
    - Allocate memory for `cmd_load_buffer_data` structure and initialize it with zero using `xcalloc`.
    - Assign the command queue item to `cdata->item`.
    - If a buffer name is provided in the arguments, duplicate it using `xstrdup` and assign it to `cdata->name`.
    - Check if the 'w' flag is set in the arguments and if the target client is not NULL; if so, assign the client to `cdata->client` and increment its reference count.
    - Format the file path from the target using `format_single_from_target` and store it in `path`.
    - Call `file_read` to read the file at `path`, passing the client, path, callback function `cmd_load_buffer_done`, and `cdata` as arguments.
    - Free the memory allocated for `path`.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_WAIT` to indicate that the command is waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` value, specifically `CMD_RETURN_WAIT`, indicating that the command execution is waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_load_buffer_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_load_buffer_exec}} -->
Loads a paste buffer from a specified file.
- **Description**: This function is used to load the contents of a file into a paste buffer, optionally associating it with a specific buffer name and client. It should be called when you need to import data from a file into the tmux environment for later use or manipulation. The function requires a valid command and command queue item, and it operates asynchronously, returning immediately while the file is read in the background. The function handles errors by reporting them through the command queue item.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the command structure representing the current command. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to the command queue item associated with this command execution. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns CMD_RETURN_WAIT to indicate that the command is executing asynchronously and will complete later.
- **See also**: [`cmd_load_buffer_exec`](#cmd_load_buffer_exec)  (Implementation)
