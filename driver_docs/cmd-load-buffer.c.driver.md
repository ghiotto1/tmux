# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux project, a terminal multiplexer, and it defines functionality for loading a paste buffer from a file. The code is structured around a command entry, `cmd_load_buffer_entry`, which specifies the command name "load-buffer" and its alias "loadb". This command is designed to be executed within the tmux environment, allowing users to load data from a specified file into a tmux paste buffer. The command accepts arguments for specifying a buffer name and a target client, and it can handle errors gracefully, providing feedback to the user if the operation fails.

The core functionality is implemented in the [`cmd_load_buffer_exec`](#cmd_load_buffer_exec) function, which sets up the necessary data structures and initiates the file reading process. The [`cmd_load_buffer_done`](#cmd_load_buffer_done) callback function is responsible for handling the completion of the file read operation. It checks for errors, copies the data into a new buffer, and sets the paste buffer if successful. The code makes use of several tmux-specific functions and data structures, such as `cmdq_item`, `client`, and `evbuffer`, to manage command execution and data handling. This file is a part of the broader tmux codebase, providing a specific utility for managing paste buffers, and it is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component of the tmux command suite.

# Global Variables

---
### cmd_load_buffer_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_load_buffer_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'load-buffer' and its alias 'loadb'. It specifies the arguments, usage, flags, and the execution function associated with this command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'load-buffer' command within the application, linking it to its execution logic.


# Data Structures

---
### cmd_load_buffer_data
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `client`: A pointer to a client structure, representing the client associated with the buffer load operation.
    - `item`: A pointer to a cmdq_item structure, representing the command queue item associated with the buffer load operation.
    - `name`: A character pointer to the name of the buffer being loaded.
- **Description**: The `cmd_load_buffer_data` structure is used to store information necessary for loading a paste buffer from a file in the context of the tmux application. It holds references to the client and command queue item involved in the operation, as well as the name of the buffer being loaded. This structure is utilized in the process of reading a file and setting its contents as a paste buffer, allowing for interaction with the client and command queue during the operation.


# Functions

---
### cmd_load_buffer_done<!-- {{#callable:cmd_load_buffer_done}} -->
The `cmd_load_buffer_done` function handles the completion of loading a paste buffer from a file, managing errors, and setting the buffer data if successful.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c`: A pointer to a client structure, marked as unused in this function.
    - `path`: A constant character pointer representing the file path from which the buffer is loaded.
    - `error`: An integer indicating if an error occurred during the file read operation.
    - `closed`: An integer flag indicating whether the file read operation has completed.
    - `buffer`: A pointer to an evbuffer structure containing the data read from the file.
    - `data`: A void pointer to additional data, specifically a `cmd_load_buffer_data` structure in this context.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the file read operation is closed; if not, return immediately.
    - If an error occurred, log the error message using `cmdq_error`.
    - If there is data in the buffer, allocate memory and copy the buffer data into it.
    - Attempt to set the paste buffer with the copied data using [`paste_set`](paste.c.driver.md#paste_set); if it fails, log the error and free allocated memory.
    - If the client is valid and not dead, set the selection in the client's terminal using [`tty_set_selection`](tty.c.driver.md#tty_set_selection).
    - Unreference the client if it is not NULL.
    - Continue the command queue item using [`cmdq_continue`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_continue).
    - Free the allocated memory for the buffer name and the `cmd_load_buffer_data` structure.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value but performs operations such as error logging, buffer setting, and memory management.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`xmalloc`](xmalloc.c.driver.md#xmalloc)
    - [`paste_set`](paste.c.driver.md#paste_set)
    - [`tty_set_selection`](tty.c.driver.md#tty_set_selection)
    - [`server_client_unref`](server-client.c.driver.md#server_client_unref)
    - [`cmdq_continue`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_continue)


---
### cmd_load_buffer_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_load_buffer_exec}} -->
The `cmd_load_buffer_exec` function initiates the loading of a paste buffer from a specified file path, potentially associating it with a client and buffer name.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item associated with this execution.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments using [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args) and store them in `args`.
    - Get the target client from the command queue item using [`cmdq_get_target_client`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target_client) and store it in `tc`.
    - Allocate memory for `cmd_load_buffer_data` structure and initialize it with zero using [`xcalloc`](xmalloc.c.driver.md#xcalloc).
    - Assign the command queue item to `cdata->item`.
    - If a buffer name is provided in the arguments, duplicate it using [`xstrdup`](xmalloc.c.driver.md#xstrdup) and assign it to `cdata->name`.
    - Check if the 'w' flag is present in the arguments and if a target client is available; if so, assign the client to `cdata->client` and increment its reference count.
    - Format the file path from the target using [`format_single_from_target`](format.c.driver.md#format_single_from_target) and store it in `path`.
    - Initiate reading the file at `path` using [`file_read`](file.c.driver.md#file_read), passing the client, path, callback function `cmd_load_buffer_done`, and `cdata`.
    - Free the allocated `path` memory.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_WAIT` to indicate that the command is waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` value, specifically `CMD_RETURN_WAIT`, indicating that the command execution is waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args)
