# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to set up the build environment for a software project, specifically tailored for systems running OpenBSD. It provides narrow functionality, focusing on configuring the necessary tools and versions required for the build process. The script checks if the operating system is OpenBSD and sets default versions for `AUTOMAKE` and `AUTOCONF` if they are not already specified. It then creates a directory named `etc` and runs a series of commands (`aclocal`, `automake`, and `autoreconf`) to prepare the build system, terminating with an error message if any of these commands fail. This script is typically used in the initial setup phase of building software from source, ensuring that the necessary build tools are correctly configured.
# Functions

---
### die
The `die` function prints an error message to standard error and terminates the script with an exit status of 1.
- **Inputs**:
    - `$@`: A list of arguments that represent the error message to be printed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses `echo` to print all arguments passed to it to the standard error stream.
    - The function then calls `exit 1` to terminate the script with an exit status of 1.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it terminates the script with an exit status of 1.
