# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to set up the build environment for a software project, specifically targeting systems running OpenBSD. It provides narrow functionality, focusing on configuring the necessary tools and versions for automake and autoconf, which are essential for generating Makefile scripts in the build process. The script checks if the operating system is OpenBSD and sets default versions for AUTOMAKE and AUTOCONF if they are not already specified. It then creates a directory named "etc" and runs a series of commands—aclocal, automake, and autoreconf—to prepare the build system, terminating with an error message if any of these steps fail. This script is typically used as part of the initial setup in a project's build process to ensure that the environment is correctly configured before compilation.
# Functions

---
### die
The `die` function prints an error message to standard error and terminates the script with an exit status of 1.
- **Inputs**:
    - `$@`: The error message to be printed to standard error.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes any number of arguments, which are expected to be error messages.
    - It prints the provided error message(s) to the standard error stream using `echo` with redirection to `>&2`.
    - The function then calls `exit 1` to terminate the script with an exit status of 1, indicating an error.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it terminates the script with an exit status of 1.
