# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and provides functionality to rename a session within tmux. The code defines a command, `rename-session`, which allows users to change the name of an existing session. The primary technical component is the [`cmd_rename_session_exec`](#cmd_rename_session_exec) function, which implements the logic for renaming a session. It checks if the new session name is valid and not already in use, updates the session name, and then notifies the system of the change. The code uses several tmux-specific structures and functions, such as `cmd`, `cmdq_item`, `session`, and `cmd_find_state`, to interact with the tmux environment.

The file defines a command entry structure, `cmd_rename_session_entry`, which specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, and execution function. This structure is part of the broader tmux command framework, allowing the `rename-session` command to be integrated into the tmux command processing system. The code is not a standalone executable but rather a component of the tmux application, intended to be compiled and linked with other parts of the tmux codebase. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but instead contributes to the internal command handling mechanism of tmux.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `stdlib.h`
- `string.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_rename_session_entry
- **Type**: `const struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_rename_session_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for renaming a session in the tmux application. It includes fields such as the command name, alias, argument specifications, usage information, target specifications, flags, and the execution function pointer. This structure is used to encapsulate all necessary information for the command to be recognized and executed within the tmux environment.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and register the 'rename-session' command, allowing users to change the name of a session in tmux.


# Functions

---
### cmd_rename_session_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_rename_session_exec}} -->
The `cmd_rename_session_exec` function renames a session in the tmux server, ensuring the new name is valid and not a duplicate.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item, which contains context for the command execution.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments using `cmd_get_args` and the target session using `cmdq_get_target`.
    - Format the new session name from the target using `format_single_from_target` and check its validity with `session_check_name`.
    - If the new name is invalid, report an error and return `CMD_RETURN_ERROR`.
    - If the new name is the same as the current session name, free the new name and return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`.
    - Check if a session with the new name already exists; if so, report an error and return `CMD_RETURN_ERROR`.
    - Remove the session from the session tree, update its name, and reinsert it into the session tree.
    - Update the server status for the session and notify that the session has been renamed.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` indicating the success or failure of the session renaming operation, specifically `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` for success and `CMD_RETURN_ERROR` for failure.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_rename_session_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_rename_session_exec}} -->
Change the name of a session.
- **Description**: This function is used to rename an existing session to a new name specified by the user. It should be called when a session needs to be renamed, ensuring that the new name is valid and not already in use by another session. The function handles errors by returning an error code if the new name is invalid or if it duplicates an existing session name. It also updates the session status and notifies listeners of the name change. The function must be called with a valid session target and a new name.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the cmd structure representing the command context. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to the cmdq_item structure representing the command queue item. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns CMD_RETURN_NORMAL on success, CMD_RETURN_ERROR if the new name is invalid or duplicates an existing session name.
- **See also**: [`cmd_rename_session_exec`](#cmd_rename_session_exec)  (Implementation)
