# Purpose
The file contents represent a `.gitignore` file, which specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in a Git repository. It includes patterns for temporary files, build artifacts, and directories such as core dumps, object files, swap files, and configuration logs, ensuring these files are not included in version control.
