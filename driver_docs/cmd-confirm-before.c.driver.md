# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the `tmux` project, a terminal multiplexer that allows users to switch between several programs in one terminal. The file defines functionality for a command named `confirm-before`, which prompts the user for confirmation before executing another command. This functionality is encapsulated in a command entry structure, `cmd_confirm_before_entry`, which specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, and execution function. The command supports options for specifying a custom confirmation key, a prompt message, and whether the default response should be affirmative.

The code includes several static functions that handle parsing arguments, executing the command, and managing the confirmation prompt's lifecycle. The [`cmd_confirm_before_exec`](#cmd_confirm_before_exec) function is responsible for setting up the confirmation prompt and determining whether to wait for user input. The [`cmd_confirm_before_callback`](#cmd_confirm_before_callback) function processes the user's response, executing the command if the confirmation is received. The [`cmd_confirm_before_free`](#cmd_confirm_before_free) function cleans up resources once the command execution is complete. This file provides a focused functionality within the `tmux` application, enhancing user interaction by requiring explicit confirmation before executing potentially disruptive commands.

### cmd_confirm_before_callback<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_confirm_before_callback}} -->
Handles the confirmation response for a command execution.
- **Description**: This function processes the user's confirmation input before executing a command. It should be called when a confirmation prompt is presented to the user, and the user's response needs to be evaluated. The function checks if the client is still active and if the response matches the expected confirmation key or the default acceptance criteria. If confirmed, it queues the command for execution. This function assumes that the client and data structures are properly initialized and that the confirmation prompt has been set up.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c`: A pointer to a client structure representing the client that issued the command. Must not be null and should represent a valid, active client.
    - `data`: A pointer to a cmd_confirm_before_data structure containing the command and confirmation details. Must not be null and should be properly initialized.
    - `s`: A string representing the user's input from the confirmation prompt. Can be null, in which case the function will not proceed with command execution.
    - `done`: An integer flag indicating if the prompt is done. This parameter is unused in the function.
- **Output**: Returns 0 after processing the confirmation input, regardless of whether the command is executed or not.
- **See also**: [`cmd_confirm_before_callback`](#cmd_confirm_before_callback)  (Implementation)
