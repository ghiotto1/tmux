# Purpose
This C source code file provides a function implementation for `getdtablesize()`, which determines the maximum number of file descriptors that a process can open. It includes necessary headers and checks for the presence of the `HAVE_SYSCONF` macro, indicating that the function `sysconf()` is available to retrieve the system configuration value `_SC_OPEN_MAX`. The code is likely part of a larger project that requires compatibility across different systems, as suggested by the inclusion of "compat.h". The file also includes a permissive license, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution of the code.

# Functions

### getdtablesize<!-- {{#callable:getdtablesize}} -->
The `getdtablesize` function returns the maximum number of file descriptors that a process can open, as determined by the system configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `sysconf` with the argument `_SC_OPEN_MAX` to retrieve the maximum number of file descriptors allowed.
    - The result from `sysconf` is returned directly as the output of the function.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an integer representing the maximum number of file descriptors that a process can open, as specified by the system configuration.
