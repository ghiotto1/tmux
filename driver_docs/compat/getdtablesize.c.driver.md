# Purpose
This C source code file provides a compatibility function for determining the maximum number of file descriptors that a process can open, specifically using the [`getdtablesize`](#getdtablesize) function. It includes necessary system headers and a custom header, "compat.h", which likely contains compatibility definitions or declarations. The function [`getdtablesize`](#getdtablesize) is conditionally compiled if the `HAVE_SYSCONF` macro is defined, indicating that the system supports the `sysconf` function. When compiled, it returns the value of `_SC_OPEN_MAX` from `sysconf`, which represents the maximum number of open files. This code is likely part of a larger project that aims to maintain compatibility across different systems by providing a consistent interface for querying system limits.

# Functions

---
### getdtablesize<!-- {{#callable:getdtablesize}} -->
The `getdtablesize` function returns the maximum number of file descriptors that a process can open, as determined by the system configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if the `HAVE_SYSCONF` macro is defined, indicating that the `sysconf` function is available.
    - If `HAVE_SYSCONF` is defined, the function calls `sysconf` with the `_SC_OPEN_MAX` argument to retrieve the maximum number of file descriptors.
    - The result from `sysconf` is returned as the output of the function.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an integer representing the maximum number of file descriptors that a process can open, as specified by the system configuration.
