# Purpose
This C source code file provides a utility function named [`closefrom`](#closefrom), which is designed to close all file descriptors greater than or equal to a specified file descriptor (`lowfd`). The code is structured to offer compatibility across different systems by checking for the presence of certain headers and system capabilities, such as `fcntl.h`, `libproc.h`, and directory access through `/proc`. The function [`closefrom`](#closefrom) is implemented with several conditional compilation paths to accommodate different system environments. If the system supports `fcntl` with the `F_CLOSEM` command, it uses that to close the file descriptors. Otherwise, it attempts to use system-specific methods like `proc_pidinfo` or directory traversal in `/proc` to identify and close file descriptors. If none of these methods are available, it falls back to a brute-force method that iterates over possible file descriptors up to a system-defined maximum.

The file is intended to be a compatibility layer, ensuring that the [`closefrom`](#closefrom) functionality is available even on systems that do not natively support it. This makes it a useful component in larger software projects that require consistent behavior across different Unix-like operating systems. The code does not define a public API in the traditional sense but provides a single function that can be included in other projects to enhance portability. The presence of multiple conditional compilation blocks indicates that the code is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various system configurations, making it a valuable utility for developers dealing with file descriptor management in a cross-platform context.

# Global Variables

---
### rcsid
- **Type**: ``static const char[]``
- **Description**: The `rcsid` variable is a static constant character array that contains a version control string. This string is used to store metadata about the file, such as the version number, date, and author, which is typically inserted by a version control system like CVS or Subversion.
- **Use**: The `rcsid` variable is used for embedding version control information within the source code file for reference and tracking purposes.


# Functions

---
### closefrom_fallback<!-- {{#callable:closefrom_fallback}} -->
The `closefrom_fallback` function closes all file descriptors starting from a specified lower bound up to the maximum possible file descriptor value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `lowfd`: An integer representing the lowest file descriptor number to start closing from.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Determine the maximum file descriptor value using `sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX)` if available, otherwise use `getdtablesize()`; if both fail, default to `OPEN_MAX`.
    - Iterate over all file descriptors from `lowfd` to `maxfd`.
    - Close each file descriptor in the range by calling `close()` on it.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it performs the side effect of closing file descriptors.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`getdtablesize`](getdtablesize.c.driver.md#getdtablesize)

### closefrom<!-- {{#callable:closefrom}} -->
The `closefrom` function closes all file descriptors greater than or equal to a specified file descriptor number.
- **Inputs**:
    - `lowfd`: An integer representing the lowest file descriptor number to be closed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks for the availability of different methods to close file descriptors, such as `fcntl` with `F_CLOSEM`, `proc_pidinfo`, or reading from `/proc/$$/fd`.
    - If `fcntl` with `F_CLOSEM` is available, it uses this method to close file descriptors starting from `lowfd`.
    - If `proc_pidinfo` is available, it retrieves the list of file descriptors for the current process and closes those greater than or equal to `lowfd`.
    - If `/proc/$$/fd` is available, it reads the directory entries to close file descriptors greater than or equal to `lowfd`.
    - If none of the above methods are available, it falls back to a brute force method using [`closefrom_fallback`](#closefrom_fallback), which iterates from `lowfd` to the maximum file descriptor limit and closes each one.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it performs the side effect of closing file descriptors.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`closefrom_fallback`](#closefrom_fallback)
