# Purpose
This C source code file provides a utility function named [`closefrom`](#closefrom), which is designed to close all file descriptors greater than or equal to a specified file descriptor (`lowfd`). The code is structured to offer compatibility across different systems by checking for the presence of various system-specific headers and functions, such as `fcntl`, `libproc`, and directory access through `/proc`. If the system supports `fcntl` with the `F_CLOSEM` command, it uses this efficient method to close file descriptors. Otherwise, it attempts to use the `/proc` filesystem or falls back to a brute-force method that iterates over possible file descriptors, closing each one.

The file is not intended to be an executable on its own but rather a utility that can be included in other projects to provide the [`closefrom`](#closefrom) functionality. It includes conditional compilation directives to adapt to different environments, ensuring broad compatibility. The code does not define a public API or external interface but instead offers a single function that can be integrated into larger applications. The presence of a copyright notice and a permissive license at the top of the file indicates that it is open-source and can be freely used and modified, provided the original notice is retained.

# Global Variables

---
### rcsid
- **Type**: ``static const char[]``
- **Description**: The `rcsid` variable is a static constant character array that contains a version control string. This string is typically used to embed version information within the source code file for tracking purposes.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store version control metadata, but it is marked as unused in the code.


# Functions

---
### closefrom_fallback<!-- {{#callable:closefrom_fallback}} -->
The `closefrom_fallback` function closes all file descriptors starting from a specified lower bound up to the maximum possible file descriptor value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `lowfd`: An integer representing the lowest file descriptor number to start closing from.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Determine the maximum file descriptor value using `sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX)` if available, otherwise use `getdtablesize()`; if both fail, default to `OPEN_MAX`.
    - Iterate over all file descriptors from `lowfd` to `maxfd`.
    - Close each file descriptor in the range by calling `close()` on it.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it performs the side effect of closing file descriptors.


---
### closefrom<!-- {{#callable:closefrom}} -->
The `closefrom` function closes all file descriptors greater than or equal to a specified file descriptor number.
- **Inputs**:
    - `lowfd`: An integer representing the lowest file descriptor number to be closed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks for the availability of different methods to close file descriptors, such as `fcntl` with `F_CLOSEM`, `proc_pidinfo`, or reading from `/proc/$$/fd`.
    - If `fcntl` with `F_CLOSEM` is available, it uses this method to close file descriptors starting from `lowfd`.
    - If `proc_pidinfo` is available, it retrieves the list of file descriptors and closes those greater than or equal to `lowfd`.
    - If `/proc/$$/fd` is available, it reads the directory entries and closes file descriptors greater than or equal to `lowfd`.
    - If none of the above methods are available, it falls back to a brute force method using [`closefrom_fallback`](#closefrom_fallback), which iterates from `lowfd` to the maximum file descriptor limit and closes each one.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it performs the side effect of closing file descriptors.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`closefrom_fallback`](#closefrom_fallback)
