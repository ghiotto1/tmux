# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to provide functionality specific to the Darwin operating system, which is the core of macOS. The primary function defined in this file is [`daemon_darwin`](#daemon_darwin), which is responsible for setting up the bootstrap port for a process, a task that is relevant when creating a daemon process on macOS. The code utilizes Mach ports, which are a fundamental part of the interprocess communication mechanism in macOS. The function checks for the availability of certain system calls and APIs, such as [`bootstrap_look_up_per_user`](#bootstrap_look_up_per_user) and [`bootstrap_get_root`](#bootstrap_get_root), which are used to manage Mach ports for user-specific services. The code is conditionally compiled to include these operations only if the system is running macOS 10.10 or later, as indicated by the `__MAC_10_10` preprocessor directive.

The file is not a standalone executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into a larger codebase, likely as part of a library or a system utility that requires daemonization on macOS. It does not define a public API or external interface but provides a specialized internal function that can be called by other parts of the software that need to perform daemonization tasks on Darwin-based systems. The presence of multiple copyright notices suggests that the code has been contributed to by different authors over time, and it is distributed under permissive open-source licenses, allowing for broad use and modification.

# Functions

### daemon_darwin<!-- {{#callable:daemon_darwin}} -->
The `daemon_darwin` function sets up a Mach bootstrap port for a daemon process on macOS systems version 10.10 and above.
- **Inputs**:
    - None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if the macOS version is 10.10 or above using the `__MAC_10_10` preprocessor directive.
    - If the macOS version is 10.10 or above, it initializes two Mach ports, `root` and `s`, to `MACH_PORT_NULL`.
    - It retrieves the current user ID using `getuid()`.
    - The function attempts to get the root bootstrap port using `bootstrap_get_root`.
    - If successful, it looks up the per-user bootstrap port using `bootstrap_look_up_per_user`.
    - If both operations are successful, it sets the task's bootstrap port to the per-user port using `task_set_bootstrap_port`.
    - Finally, it deallocates the original bootstrap port and assigns the new port to `bootstrap_port`.
    - If the macOS version is below 10.10, the function does nothing.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return any value; it modifies the global `bootstrap_port` variable if successful.
