# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to provide functionality specific to the Darwin operating system, which is the core of macOS. The primary function defined in this file is [`daemon_darwin`](#daemon_darwin), which is responsible for setting up the bootstrap port for a process, a task that is relevant when creating a daemon process on macOS. The code utilizes Mach ports, which are a fundamental part of the interprocess communication mechanism in macOS. The function checks for the availability of certain system calls and APIs, such as `bootstrap_look_up_per_user` and `bootstrap_get_root`, which are used to manage Mach ports for user-specific services. The code is conditionally compiled to include these operations only if the system supports macOS 10.10 or later, as indicated by the `__MAC_10_10` preprocessor directive.

The file is not a standalone executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into a larger codebase, likely as part of a library or a system utility that requires daemonization on macOS. It does not define a public API or external interface but instead provides a specialized internal function that interacts with the macOS system's Mach port infrastructure. The presence of multiple copyright notices suggests that the code has been developed and modified by different contributors over time, with permissions for use and modification clearly outlined.

# Functions

### daemon_darwin<!-- {{#callable:daemon_darwin}} -->
The `daemon_darwin` function sets up a Mach bootstrap port for a user-specific service on macOS 10.10 and later.
- **Inputs**:
    - None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the macOS version is 10.10 or later using the `__MAC_10_10` preprocessor directive.
    - Declare and initialize `mach_port_t` variables `root` and `s` to `MACH_PORT_NULL`.
    - Retrieve the current user's UID using `getuid()`.
    - Attempt to get the root bootstrap port using `bootstrap_get_root`.
    - If successful, look up a per-user bootstrap port using `bootstrap_look_up_per_user`.
    - If successful, set the task's bootstrap port to the user-specific port using `task_set_bootstrap_port`.
    - Deallocate the original bootstrap port using `mach_port_deallocate`.
    - Assign the new user-specific bootstrap port to `bootstrap_port`.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value, but it modifies the global `bootstrap_port` to point to a user-specific Mach bootstrap port if successful.
