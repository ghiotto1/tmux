# Purpose
This C source code file provides a utility function [`htonll`](#htonll), which converts a 64-bit integer from host byte order to network byte order. The function is particularly useful in network programming where data needs to be transmitted over the network in a standardized format, typically big-endian. The code includes necessary headers for network operations and type definitions, and it relies on the `htonl` function to handle the conversion of 32-bit segments of the 64-bit integer. The file also includes a permissive software license, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution, while disclaiming any warranties.

# Functions

### htonll<!-- {{#callable:htonll}} -->
The `htonll` function converts a 64-bit integer from host byte order to network byte order.
- **Inputs**:
    - `v`: A 64-bit unsigned integer that needs to be converted from host byte order to network byte order.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a 64-bit integer `v` as input.
    - It splits `v` into two 32-bit parts: the lower 32 bits and the upper 32 bits.
    - The lower 32 bits are converted to network byte order using `htonl` and stored in `b`.
    - The upper 32 bits are shifted right by 32 bits, converted to network byte order using `htonl`, and stored in `t`.
    - The function combines `b` and `t` by shifting `b` left by 32 bits and performing a bitwise OR with `t`.
    - The combined result is returned as a 64-bit integer in network byte order.
- **Output**:
    - A 64-bit unsigned integer in network byte order.
