# Purpose
This C source code file implements the [`strsep`](#strsep) function, which is a utility function used to tokenize a string based on a set of delimiter characters. The function modifies the input string by inserting null characters (`\0`) to terminate each token, and updates the pointer to the string to point to the next token or set it to `NULL` if no more tokens are available. The [`strsep`](#strsep) function is particularly useful in parsing strings where the delimiters may vary between calls, offering flexibility in tokenization. The file includes standard headers and a compatibility header, suggesting it may be part of a larger codebase that requires cross-platform support. The code is distributed under a permissive license, allowing for wide use and modification with certain conditions.

# Functions

### strsep<!-- {{#callable:strsep}} -->
The `strsep` function extracts the next token from a string, separated by any of the characters in a delimiter string, and updates the string pointer to point past the token.
- **Inputs**:
    - `stringp`: A pointer to a pointer to the string to be tokenized; it is updated to point past the last token found.
    - `delim`: A string containing delimiter characters that separate tokens in the input string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input string pointer `*stringp` is NULL; if so, return NULL immediately.
    - Initialize `s` to point to the current position in the string and `tok` to the start of the token.
    - Enter an infinite loop to iterate over the characters in the string `s`.
    - For each character `c` in the string, iterate over the delimiter string `delim` using `spanp`.
    - If a delimiter character `sc` matches the current character `c`, check if `c` is the null terminator; if so, set `s` to NULL, otherwise replace the delimiter with a null character to terminate the token.
    - Update `*stringp` to point to the next character after the token and return the token `tok`.
    - Continue the loop until a delimiter is found or the end of the string is reached.
- **Output**:
    - Returns a pointer to the next token found in the string, or NULL if no more tokens are available.
