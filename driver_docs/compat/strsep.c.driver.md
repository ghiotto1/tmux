# Purpose
This C source code file implements the [`strsep`](#strsep) function, which is a utility function used to tokenize a string based on a set of delimiter characters. The function takes a pointer to a string pointer (`stringp`) and a string of delimiters (`delim`). It iterates through the string, replacing delimiter characters with null terminators (`\0`) to separate tokens, and updates the string pointer to point to the next potential token. If the input string pointer is `NULL`, the function returns `NULL`, indicating no more tokens are available. This implementation is part of the OpenBSD project and includes a standard BSD license, allowing for redistribution and use under specified conditions.

### strsep<!-- {{#callable:strsep}} -->
The `strsep` function extracts the next token from a string, using a specified set of delimiter characters, and updates the string pointer to point past the token.
- **Inputs**:
    - `stringp`: A pointer to a pointer to the string to be tokenized; it is updated to point past the last token found.
    - `delim`: A string containing delimiter characters that separate tokens in the input string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input string pointer `*stringp` is NULL; if so, return NULL immediately.
    - Initialize `s` to point to the current position in the string and `tok` to the start of the token.
    - Enter an infinite loop to iterate over the characters in the string pointed to by `s`.
    - For each character `c` in the string, iterate over the delimiter characters `spanp`.
    - If a delimiter character `sc` matches the current character `c`, check if `c` is the null terminator; if so, set `s` to NULL, otherwise replace the delimiter with a null character to terminate the token.
    - Update `*stringp` to point to the next character after the token and return the token `tok`.
    - Continue the loop until a delimiter is found or the end of the string is reached.
- **Output**:
    - Returns a pointer to the next token found in the string, or NULL if no more tokens are available.
