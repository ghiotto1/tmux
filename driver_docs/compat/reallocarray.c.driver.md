# Purpose
The provided C source code file defines a function [`reallocarray`](#reallocarray), which is an extension of the standard `realloc` function. This function is designed to allocate memory for an array, ensuring that the multiplication of the number of elements (`nmemb`) and the size of each element (`size`) does not result in an overflow, which could lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. The function checks if either `nmemb` or `size` is large enough to potentially cause an overflow when multiplied, using a defined constant `MUL_NO_OVERFLOW` as a threshold. If an overflow condition is detected, it sets the `errno` to `ENOMEM` and returns `NULL`, indicating a memory allocation failure. Otherwise, it proceeds to call the standard `realloc` function to adjust the memory allocation.

This code provides a narrow but crucial functionality, focusing on safe memory allocation practices in C programming. It is intended to be part of a library or a larger codebase where safe dynamic memory management is necessary. The inclusion of headers like `<sys/types.h>`, `<errno.h>`, `<stdint.h>`, and `<stdlib.h>` suggests that it relies on standard system and library types and functions. The file does not define a public API or external interface by itself but rather enhances the robustness of memory allocation operations, making it a valuable utility in environments where security and stability are paramount.

# Functions

---
### reallocarray<!-- {{#callable:reallocarray}} -->
The `reallocarray` function reallocates memory for an array, ensuring that the total size does not overflow.
- **Inputs**:
    - `optr`: A pointer to the previously allocated memory block that needs to be reallocated.
    - `nmemb`: The number of elements in the array to allocate memory for.
    - `size`: The size of each element in the array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if either `nmemb` or `size` is greater than or equal to `MUL_NO_OVERFLOW`, and if `nmemb` is greater than 0 and the product of `nmemb` and `size` would overflow `SIZE_MAX`.
    - If the above condition is true, set `errno` to `ENOMEM` and return `NULL` to indicate a memory allocation error.
    - If the condition is false, call `realloc` with the original pointer and the product of `nmemb` and `size` to reallocate the memory.
- **Output**:
    - Returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory block, or `NULL` if the allocation fails due to overflow or other reasons.
