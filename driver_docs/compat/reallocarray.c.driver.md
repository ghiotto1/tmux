# Purpose
The provided C source code file defines a function [`reallocarray`](#reallocarray), which is an extension to the standard memory allocation functions in C. This function is designed to safely allocate memory for an array by multiplying the number of elements (`nmemb`) by the size of each element (`size`). The primary purpose of [`reallocarray`](#reallocarray) is to prevent integer overflow during this multiplication, which can lead to insufficient memory allocation and potential security vulnerabilities. The function checks if either `nmemb` or `size` is large enough to cause an overflow when multiplied, using a defined threshold `MUL_NO_OVERFLOW`. If an overflow condition is detected, it sets the `errno` to `ENOMEM` and returns `NULL`, indicating a failure to allocate memory.

This code provides a narrow but crucial functionality, enhancing the robustness of dynamic memory allocation in C programs. It is intended to be part of a library that can be included in other projects, as indicated by the inclusion of a custom header file "compat.h". The function does not define a public API or external interface by itself but serves as a safer alternative to the standard `realloc` function. The inclusion of standard headers like `<sys/types.h>`, `<errno.h>`, `<stdint.h>`, and `<stdlib.h>` suggests that this function is designed to be portable and compatible with various systems, adhering to standard C library practices.

# Functions

---
### reallocarray<!-- {{#callable:reallocarray}} -->
The `reallocarray` function reallocates memory for an array, ensuring that the total size does not overflow.
- **Inputs**:
    - `optr`: A pointer to the previously allocated memory block that needs to be reallocated.
    - `nmemb`: The number of elements in the array.
    - `size`: The size of each element in the array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function first checks if either `nmemb` or `size` is greater than or equal to `MUL_NO_OVERFLOW`, and if `nmemb` is greater than 0, it then checks if the multiplication of `nmemb` and `size` would overflow by comparing `SIZE_MAX / nmemb` with `size`.
    - If the multiplication would overflow, it sets `errno` to `ENOMEM` and returns `NULL`.
    - If the multiplication does not overflow, it calls `realloc` with the product of `nmemb` and `size` to reallocate the memory.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory block, or `NULL` if the allocation fails due to overflow or other reasons.
