# Purpose
This C source code file provides a utility function, [`getprogname`](#getprogname), which returns the name of the currently running program. It is designed to be compatible across different systems by checking for the presence of specific macros, such as `HAVE_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_SHORT_NAME` and `HAVE___PROGNAME`, which indicate the availability of system-specific variables for retrieving the program name. If neither of these macros is defined, it defaults to returning the string "tmux". This code is likely part of a larger project, possibly related to the "tmux" terminal multiplexer, and ensures that the program name can be consistently retrieved regardless of the underlying system.

### getprogname<!-- {{#callable:getprogname}} -->
The `getprogname` function returns the name of the program as a string, using different methods based on available system features.
- **Inputs**:
    - None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if `HAVE_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_SHORT_NAME` is defined; if so, it returns `program_invocation_short_name`.
    - If `HAVE_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_SHORT_NAME` is not defined, it checks if `HAVE___PROGNAME` is defined; if so, it returns the external variable `__progname`.
    - If neither of the above conditions are met, it defaults to returning the string "tmux".
- **Output**:
    - The function returns a constant character pointer to the program name, which is either `program_invocation_short_name`, `__progname`, or the string "tmux" depending on the system configuration.
