# Purpose
This code is a simple C source file that defines the function [`explicit_bzero`](#explicit_bzero), which is used to securely clear a block of memory by setting it to zero. The function takes a pointer `buf` and a size `len` as arguments, and it uses the `memset` function to overwrite the specified memory region with zeros. This is typically used to ensure that sensitive data, such as passwords or cryptographic keys, are removed from memory to prevent unauthorized access. The inclusion of "compat.h" suggests that this function might be part of a compatibility layer, ensuring consistent behavior across different systems. The file is marked as public domain, indicating that it can be freely used and modified.

# Functions

### explicit_bzero<!-- {{#callable:explicit_bzero}} -->
The function `explicit_bzero` sets a specified number of bytes in a buffer to zero.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to the buffer that needs to be zeroed out.
    - `len`: The number of bytes to set to zero in the buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `memset` with the buffer pointer, a value of 0, and the length to zero out the specified number of bytes in the buffer.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return any value; it performs an in-place operation on the buffer.
