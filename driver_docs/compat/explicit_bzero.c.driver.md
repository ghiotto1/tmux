# Purpose
This code is a simple C source file that defines the function [`explicit_bzero`](#explicit_bzero), which is used to securely clear a block of memory by setting it to zero. The function takes a pointer `buf` and a size `len` as arguments, and it uses the `memset` function to overwrite the specified memory area with zeros. The purpose of [`explicit_bzero`](#explicit_bzero) is to ensure that sensitive data, such as passwords or cryptographic keys, is reliably erased from memory, preventing potential data leaks. The inclusion of "compat.h" suggests that this function might be part of a compatibility layer, ensuring consistent behavior across different platforms or environments. The file is marked as public domain, indicating that it can be freely used and modified.

### explicit_bzero<!-- {{#callable:explicit_bzero}} -->
The `explicit_bzero` function securely clears a memory buffer by setting all its bytes to zero.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to the memory buffer that needs to be cleared.
    - `len`: The number of bytes in the buffer to be set to zero.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `memset`, passing the buffer pointer `buf`, the value `0`, and the length `len` to set all bytes in the specified memory region to zero.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return any value; it performs an operation on the memory buffer directly.
