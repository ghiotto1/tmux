# Purpose
This C source code file provides a specific functionality related to pseudo-terminal (PTY) management, specifically implementing a [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function. The [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function is designed to create a new pseudo-terminal pair, fork a child process, and establish the child process's terminal settings. This function is crucial for applications that require terminal emulation, such as terminal multiplexers or remote shell applications. The code includes system calls and library functions to handle terminal operations, such as `open`, `grantpt`, `unlockpt`, and `ioctl`, which are essential for managing PTY devices and configuring terminal attributes.

The file is not a standalone executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into a larger application or library. It does not define a public API or external interface beyond the [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function itself, which is the primary focus of the file. The function handles error conditions robustly, ensuring that resources are properly released in case of failure. The inclusion of headers like `<sys/types.h>`, `<sys/ioctl.h>`, and `<termios.h>` indicates its reliance on system-level operations and terminal control, making it a specialized utility for developers working with terminal-based applications.

# Functions

---
### forkpty<!-- {{#callable:forkpty}} -->
The `forkpty` function creates a pseudo-terminal pair, forks a new process, and sets up the terminal environment for the child process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `master`: A pointer to an integer where the file descriptor for the master side of the pseudo-terminal will be stored.
    - `name`: A character array where the name of the slave pseudo-terminal device will be copied, if not NULL.
    - `tio`: A pointer to a `struct termios` that contains terminal attributes to be set for the slave pseudo-terminal, if not NULL.
    - `ws`: A pointer to a `struct winsize` that contains window size attributes to be set for the slave pseudo-terminal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Open the master side of the pseudo-terminal using `/dev/ptmx` and store the file descriptor in `master`.
    - Grant access to the slave pseudo-terminal using `grantpt` and unlock it using `unlockpt`.
    - Retrieve the name of the slave pseudo-terminal using `ptsname` and copy it to `name` if `name` is not NULL.
    - Open the slave side of the pseudo-terminal using the retrieved name.
    - Fork the process; in the child process, close the master file descriptor, create a new session, and set the controlling terminal if `TIOCSCTTY` is defined.
    - Push terminal line discipline modules `ptem` and `ldterm` onto the slave file descriptor.
    - Set terminal attributes using `tcsetattr` if `tio` is not NULL and set window size using `ioctl` with `TIOCSWINSZ`.
    - Duplicate the slave file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and close the slave file descriptor if it is greater than 2.
    - In the parent process, close the slave file descriptor and return the child's process ID.
    - If any error occurs, close any open file descriptors and return -1.
- **Output**:
    - Returns the process ID of the child process in the parent, 0 in the child, or -1 on error.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`strlcpy`](strlcpy.c.driver.md#strlcpy)
    - [`fatal`](../log.c.driver.md#fatal)
