# Purpose
This C source code file provides a utility function, [`setproctitle`](#setproctitle), which is used to set the process title of a running program. The functionality is conditional, depending on the availability of the `prctl` system call and the `PR_SET_NAME` option, which are typically available on Linux systems. The code includes necessary headers and checks for these features using preprocessor directives. If the conditions are met, the function constructs a new process title using a formatted string and the program's name, then sets it using `prctl`. If the conditions are not met, a placeholder function is defined that does nothing, ensuring compatibility across different systems.

The file is designed to be part of a larger codebase, likely as a utility or compatibility layer, given the inclusion of a custom header file "compat.h". It does not define a main function, indicating that it is not an executable but rather a component intended to be included in other programs. The function [`setproctitle`](#setproctitle) is a public API that can be used by other parts of the program to modify the process title, which can be useful for monitoring and debugging purposes. The code is distributed under a permissive license, allowing for wide use and modification.

# Functions

---
### setproctitle<!-- {{#callable:setproctitle}} -->
The `setproctitle` function sets the process title for the current process, but is a no-op if the necessary system calls are not available.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how the process title should be formatted, but is unused in this implementation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as a no-op (no operation) when the necessary system calls (`prctl` and `PR_SET_NAME`) are not available.
    - The function signature includes a format string and variadic arguments, but these are not used in this no-op implementation.
- **Output**:
    - This implementation of `setproctitle` does not produce any output or perform any operations.
