# Purpose
This C source code file provides a function named [`setproctitle`](#setproctitle), which is designed to set the process title for a running program. The functionality is conditional, depending on the availability of certain system features, specifically the `prctl` system call with the `PR_SET_NAME` option, which is typically available on Linux systems. The code includes necessary headers and checks for these features using preprocessor directives. If the required features are present, the function constructs a new process title using a formatted string and sets it using `prctl`. If the features are not available, the function is defined as a no-operation, effectively doing nothing.

The code is a utility function that can be included in other programs to provide the capability of changing the process name as it appears in system tools like `ps` or `top`. It is not a standalone executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into larger applications. The function uses variable argument lists to allow flexible formatting of the process title, similar to `printf`. This file does not define a public API or external interface but provides a specific utility function that can be conditionally compiled based on the system's capabilities.

# Functions

---
### setproctitle<!-- {{#callable:setproctitle}} -->
The `setproctitle` function sets the process title for the current process, but in this implementation, it is a no-op due to the absence of certain system capabilities.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fmt`: A format string for the process title, which is unused in this implementation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as a no-op (no operation) because the preprocessor conditions for `HAVE_PRCTL` and `HAVE_PR_SET_NAME` are not met.
    - The function takes a format string and variadic arguments, but these are not used in this implementation.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not produce any output or perform any operations in this implementation.
