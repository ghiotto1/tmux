# Purpose
This C source code file provides implementations for two functions, [`setenv`](#setenv) and [`unsetenv`](#unsetenv), which are used to manipulate environment variables in a Unix-like operating system. The file includes necessary headers for system types and standard library functions, and it also includes a custom header, "compat.h", which likely provides compatibility definitions or utility functions. The [`setenv`](#setenv) function constructs a new environment variable string in the format "name=value" and uses `putenv` to add it to the environment. The `overwrite` parameter is marked as unused, indicating that this implementation does not consider whether to overwrite existing variables. The [`unsetenv`](#unsetenv) function removes an environment variable by iterating through the environment list, identifying the target variable by name, and shifting subsequent entries to fill the gap.

This code is part of a broader system or library that deals with environment variable management, providing a narrow but essential functionality. It is not a standalone executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into larger applications or systems. The functions defined here do not expose a public API in the traditional sense but offer a specific interface for managing environment variables, which can be utilized by other parts of a program. The presence of a permissive license at the top of the file suggests that this code can be freely used and modified, making it suitable for inclusion in open-source projects.

# Functions

---
### setenv<!-- {{#callable:setenv}} -->
The `setenv` function sets an environment variable to a specified value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `name`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the name of the environment variable to set.
    - `value`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the value to assign to the environment variable.
    - `overwrite`: An integer flag indicating whether to overwrite the existing environment variable value, but it is unused in this implementation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory and format a new string `newval` combining the `name` and `value` in the format 'name=value' using [`xasprintf`](../xmalloc.c.driver.md#xasprintf).
    - Call `putenv` with `newval` to add or change the environment variable.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns the result of the `putenv` function, which is 0 on success and a non-zero value on failure.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`xasprintf`](../xmalloc.c.driver.md#xasprintf)


---
### unsetenv<!-- {{#callable:unsetenv}} -->
The `unsetenv` function removes an environment variable from the environment list.
- **Inputs**:
    - `name`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the name of the environment variable to be removed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the length of the environment variable name using `strlen`.
    - Iterate over the environment list using a pointer `envptr` until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.
    - For each environment variable, compare the name with the current environment variable using `strncmp` and check if the character following the name is '=' or '\0'.
    - If a match is found, break out of the loop.
    - Shift all subsequent environment variables one position up in the list to remove the matched variable.
    - Continue shifting until the end of the list is reached, effectively removing the variable.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful completion.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns 0 to indicate successful removal of the environment variable.
