# Purpose
The provided C source code file defines a function named [`recallocarray`](#recallocarray), which is designed to reallocate memory for an array while ensuring that any newly allocated memory is zeroed out. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where the size of an array needs to be adjusted dynamically, and it is crucial to maintain data integrity by initializing any additional memory to zero. The function handles both increasing and decreasing the size of the array, and it includes checks to prevent integer overflow during size calculations, which could otherwise lead to security vulnerabilities or program crashes.

The [`recallocarray`](#recallocarray) function is a specialized utility that extends the functionality of standard memory allocation functions like `calloc` and `realloc`. It is implemented with careful consideration of memory management best practices, such as checking for potential overflow conditions using the `MUL_NO_OVERFLOW` macro and ensuring that memory is explicitly zeroed out before being freed. This function is part of a broader library or system, as indicated by the inclusion of a custom header file "compat.h", and it is intended to be used in environments where robust and secure memory handling is required. The code is structured to be portable and efficient, making it a valuable component for developers working on systems programming or applications that require dynamic memory management.

# Functions

### recallocarray<!-- {{#callable:recallocarray}} -->
The `recallocarray` function reallocates a memory block to a new size, initializing any additional memory to zero, and handles potential overflow conditions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: A pointer to the previously allocated memory block.
    - `oldnmemb`: The number of elements in the old memory block.
    - `newnmemb`: The number of elements in the new memory block.
    - `size`: The size of each element in bytes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - If `ptr` is NULL, allocate a new block using `calloc` for `newnmemb` elements of `size` bytes each and return it.
    - Check for potential overflow in the multiplication of `newnmemb` and `size`; if overflow is possible, set `errno` to `ENOMEM` and return NULL.
    - Calculate `newsize` as the product of `newnmemb` and `size`.
    - Check for potential overflow in the multiplication of `oldnmemb` and `size`; if overflow is possible, set `errno` to `EINVAL` and return NULL.
    - Calculate `oldsize` as the product of `oldnmemb` and `size`.
    - If the new size is less than or equal to the old size, and the difference is small, zero out the excess memory and return the original pointer.
    - Allocate a new memory block of `newsize` bytes using `malloc`; if allocation fails, return NULL.
    - If the new size is greater than the old size, copy the old data to the new block and zero out the additional memory.
    - If the new size is less than or equal to the old size, copy the data up to the new size.
    - Zero out the old memory block using `explicit_bzero` and free it.
    - Return the pointer to the new memory block.
- **Output**:
    - A pointer to the newly allocated memory block, or NULL if an error occurs.
