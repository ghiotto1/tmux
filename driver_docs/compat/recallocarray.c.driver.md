# Purpose
The provided C source code file defines a function named [`recallocarray`](#recallocarray), which is designed to reallocate memory for an array while ensuring that the newly allocated memory is zeroed out. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where the size of an array needs to be adjusted dynamically, either increasing or decreasing, while maintaining data integrity and preventing memory leaks. The function takes four parameters: a pointer to the existing memory block (`ptr`), the old number of elements (`oldnmemb`), the new number of elements (`newnmemb`), and the size of each element (`size`). It handles various edge cases, such as when the pointer is `NULL`, which triggers a call to `calloc` to allocate a new block of memory, or when the multiplication of the number of elements and the size of each element could potentially overflow, in which case it sets the appropriate error code and returns `NULL`.

The code includes several important technical components, such as checks to prevent integer overflow during memory size calculations, and it uses functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `memcpy`, and `explicit_bzero` to manage memory allocation and initialization. The use of `explicit_bzero` ensures that the old memory is securely cleared before being freed, which is crucial for security-sensitive applications. The function is part of a broader library or system, as indicated by the inclusion of a custom header file "compat.h", suggesting that it may be intended for use in environments where compatibility with different systems or standards is necessary. This file does not define a public API or external interface by itself but provides a utility function that can be used internally within a larger codebase to manage dynamic memory allocation safely and efficiently.

# Functions

### recallocarray<!-- {{#callable:recallocarray}} -->
The `recallocarray` function reallocates a memory block to a new size, initializing any additional memory to zero, and handles potential overflow conditions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: A pointer to the previously allocated memory block, or NULL if a new allocation is needed.
    - `oldnmemb`: The number of elements in the old memory block.
    - `newnmemb`: The number of elements in the new memory block.
    - `size`: The size of each element in bytes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - If `ptr` is NULL, allocate a new block using `calloc` for `newnmemb` elements of `size` bytes each and return it.
    - Check for potential overflow in the calculation of `newsize` (newnmemb * size) and return NULL with `ENOMEM` if overflow is detected.
    - Calculate `newsize` as `newnmemb * size`.
    - Check for potential overflow in the calculation of `oldsize` (oldnmemb * size) and return NULL with `EINVAL` if overflow is detected.
    - Calculate `oldsize` as `oldnmemb * size`.
    - If the new size is less than or equal to the old size and the difference is small, zero out the excess memory and return the original pointer.
    - Allocate a new memory block of `newsize` bytes using `malloc`.
    - If allocation fails, return NULL.
    - If the new size is greater than the old size, copy the old data to the new block and zero out the additional memory.
    - If the new size is less than or equal to the old size, copy only the necessary data to the new block.
    - Zero out the old memory block using [`explicit_bzero`](explicit_bzero.c.driver.md#explicit_bzero) and free it.
    - Return the pointer to the new memory block.
- **Output**:
    - A pointer to the newly allocated memory block, or NULL if an error occurs.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`explicit_bzero`](explicit_bzero.c.driver.md#explicit_bzero)
