# Purpose
This C source code file provides a utility function, [`ntohll`](#ntohll), which converts a 64-bit integer from network byte order to host byte order. The function is particularly useful in network programming where data is often transmitted in network byte order (big-endian) and needs to be converted to the host's native byte order for processing. The code includes necessary headers for network operations and type definitions, and it uses the `ntohl` function to handle the conversion of 32-bit segments of the 64-bit integer. The file also includes a permissive license, allowing for free use and distribution of the code, with a disclaimer of warranties.

# Functions

### ntohll<!-- {{#callable:ntohll}} -->
The `ntohll` function converts a 64-bit integer from network byte order to host byte order.
- **Inputs**:
    - `v`: A 64-bit unsigned integer in network byte order that needs to be converted to host byte order.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function splits the 64-bit input `v` into two 32-bit halves.
    - The lower 32 bits of `v` are extracted using `v & 0xffffffff` and converted from network to host byte order using `ntohl`, storing the result in `b`.
    - The upper 32 bits of `v` are extracted by right-shifting `v` by 32 bits and converted from network to host byte order using `ntohl`, storing the result in `t`.
    - The function combines the converted 32-bit halves by left-shifting `b` by 32 bits and performing a bitwise OR with `t`, resulting in the final 64-bit host byte order value.
- **Output**:
    - A 64-bit unsigned integer in host byte order.
