# Purpose
This C source code file implements the [`strcasestr`](#strcasestr) function, which is a utility function used to locate the first occurrence of a substring within a string, ignoring case differences. The function takes two string arguments: `s`, the string to be searched, and `find`, the substring to search for. It returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the substring in the string, or `NULL` if the substring is not found. The implementation uses standard C library functions such as `tolower`, `strlen`, and `strncasecmp` to perform case-insensitive comparisons. This code is a part of the OpenBSD and NetBSD projects, as indicated by the version control comments, and it includes a Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, allowing for broad use and modification under specified conditions.

### strcasestr<!-- {{#callable:strcasestr}} -->
The `strcasestr` function searches for the first occurrence of a substring in a string, ignoring case differences.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: The main string in which to search for the substring.
    - `find`: The substring to search for within the main string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the first character of 'find' is not null; if it is, return NULL immediately.
    - Convert the first character of 'find' to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
    - Calculate the length of the remaining 'find' string after the first character.
    - Enter a loop to iterate over each character in 's'.
    - Within the loop, check if the current character in 's' is null; if so, return NULL as the substring cannot be found.
    - Convert the current character in 's' to lowercase and compare it with the first character of 'find'.
    - If they match, use `strncasecmp` to compare the rest of the 'find' string with the corresponding part of 's', ignoring case.
    - If `strncasecmp` returns 0, indicating a match, break out of the loop and return the current position in 's'.
    - If no match is found, continue iterating through 's'.
- **Output**:
    - Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the substring in the main string, or NULL if the substring is not found.
