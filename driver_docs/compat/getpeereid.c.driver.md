# Purpose
This C source code file provides a function named [`getpeereid`](#getpeereid), which is designed to retrieve the effective user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) of the peer connected to a socket. The function is implemented to support different system environments by using conditional compilation directives. It checks for the presence of specific features or headers, such as `SO_PEERCRED` and `getpeerucred`, to determine the appropriate method for obtaining the peer credentials. If these features are not available, it defaults to using the effective UID and GID of the current process. This approach ensures compatibility across various Unix-like operating systems.

The file includes necessary system headers like `<sys/types.h>`, `<sys/socket.h>`, and `<unistd.h>`, which are essential for socket operations and process identification. The presence of the `compat.h` header suggests that this file is part of a larger codebase that aims to provide compatibility across different platforms. The function does not define a public API or external interface but rather serves as a utility function that can be used internally within a program to obtain peer credentials in a platform-independent manner. The inclusion of a permissive license at the top of the file indicates that the code can be freely used and modified, which is typical for open-source software.

# Functions

### getpeereid<!-- {{#callable:getpeereid}} -->
The `getpeereid` function retrieves the effective user ID and group ID of the peer connected to a socket.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: The socket file descriptor for which the peer credentials are to be retrieved.
    - `uid`: A pointer to a `uid_t` variable where the effective user ID of the peer will be stored.
    - `gid`: A pointer to a `gid_t` variable where the effective group ID of the peer will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `HAVE_SO_PEERCRED` macro is defined.
    - If `HAVE_SO_PEERCRED` is defined, use `getsockopt` with `SO_PEERCRED` to retrieve the peer credentials and store them in the provided `uid` and `gid` pointers.
    - If `HAVE_GETPEERUCRED` is defined instead, use `getpeerucred` to obtain a `ucred_t` structure, extract the effective user ID and group ID using `ucred_geteuid` and `ucred_getrgid`, and store them in the provided `uid` and `gid` pointers, then free the `ucred_t` structure.
    - If neither `HAVE_SO_PEERCRED` nor `HAVE_GETPEERUCRED` is defined, fall back to using `geteuid` and `getegid` to set the `uid` and `gid` to the effective user ID and group ID of the current process.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns 0 on success, indicating that the peer's user ID and group ID were successfully retrieved, or -1 on failure, indicating an error occurred during the retrieval process.
