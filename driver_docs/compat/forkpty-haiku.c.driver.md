# Purpose
This C source code file provides a specific functionality related to pseudo-terminal (PTY) management, specifically implementing a [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function. The [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function is designed to create a new pseudo-terminal pair, fork a new process, and establish the child process's terminal settings. This function is particularly useful in terminal emulation and process management scenarios, where a program needs to interact with a terminal device programmatically. The code includes system calls and functions such as `open`, `grantpt`, `unlockpt`, `ptsname`, and `ioctl`, which are essential for managing PTYs and setting terminal attributes. The function also handles error conditions gracefully by cleaning up resources before returning in case of failure.

The file is not a standalone executable but rather a component that can be integrated into larger systems requiring PTY functionality. It does not define a public API or external interface beyond the [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function itself, which is the primary focus of the file. The inclusion of headers like `<sys/types.h>`, `<sys/ioctl.h>`, and `<fcntl.h>` indicates its reliance on system-level operations, making it suitable for Unix-like operating systems. The presence of the [`fatal`](#fatal) and [`fatalx`](#fatalx) functions suggests that error handling is a critical aspect of this code, although their implementations are not provided in this snippet. Overall, this file provides a narrow, specialized functionality that is crucial for applications needing to manage terminal sessions programmatically.

# Functions

---
### forkpty<!-- {{#callable:forkpty}} -->
The `forkpty` function creates a pseudo-terminal pair, forks a new process, and sets up the child process to use the slave side of the pseudo-terminal as its controlling terminal.
- **Inputs**:
    - `master`: A pointer to an integer where the file descriptor for the master side of the pseudo-terminal will be stored.
    - `name`: A character array where the name of the slave pseudo-terminal device will be copied, if not NULL.
    - `tio`: A pointer to a `struct termios` that specifies terminal attributes to be set on the slave side, if not NULL.
    - `ws`: A pointer to a `struct winsize` that specifies the window size to be set on the slave side, if not NULL.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Open the master side of the pseudo-terminal using `/dev/ptmx` and store the file descriptor in `master`.
    - Grant access to the slave pseudo-terminal using `grantpt` and unlock it using `unlockpt`.
    - Retrieve the name of the slave pseudo-terminal using `ptsname` and copy it to `name` if `name` is not NULL.
    - Open the slave side of the pseudo-terminal using the retrieved name.
    - Fork the process; in the child process, close the master file descriptor, create a new session, and set the slave as the controlling terminal.
    - Set terminal attributes and window size on the slave side if `tio` and `ws` are provided.
    - Redirect standard input, output, and error to the slave file descriptor and close it if it's greater than 2.
    - In the parent process, close the slave file descriptor and return the child's process ID.
    - If any error occurs, close any open file descriptors and return -1.
- **Output**:
    - Returns the process ID of the child process to the parent, 0 to the child process, or -1 on error.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fatal<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fatal}} -->
Logs a fatal error message and terminates the program.
- **Description**: This function is used to log a fatal error message and immediately terminate the program. It should be called when a non-recoverable error occurs, and the program cannot continue execution safely. The function formats the error message using a printf-style format string and additional arguments, appending the current error string from errno. It then logs the message and exits the program with a status code of 1. This function does not return, and any resources held by the program will not be released unless handled by the operating system.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A printf-style format string that describes the error. It must not be null and should be a valid format string. Additional arguments should match the format specifiers in this string.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fatal`](../log.c.driver.md#fatal)  (Implementation)


---
### fatalx<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fatalx}} -->
Logs a fatal error message and terminates the program.
- **Description**: Use this function to log a critical error message and immediately terminate the program. It is intended for situations where continuing execution is not possible or safe. The function formats the error message using a printf-style format string and additional arguments, then logs it with a 'fatal: ' prefix. After logging, the function exits the program with a status code of 1. This function does not return, and any resources not explicitly released before calling it will remain allocated.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A printf-style format string for the error message. Must not be null. The format string is used to construct the final error message, which is prefixed with 'fatal: '.
    - `...`: Additional arguments to be formatted into the message string according to the format specifiers in 'msg'. These arguments must match the expected types for the format specifiers used in 'msg'.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fatalx`](../log.c.driver.md#fatalx)  (Implementation)
