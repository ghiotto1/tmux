# Purpose
This C source code file provides a specific functionality related to pseudo-terminal (PTY) management, specifically implementing a [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function. The [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function is designed to create a new pseudo-terminal pair, fork a child process, and establish the child process's terminal settings. This function is crucial for applications that require terminal emulation, such as terminal multiplexers or remote shell applications. The code handles the opening of the master side of the PTY, grants access, unlocks it, and retrieves the slave device's path. It then forks a new process, where the child process sets up a new session, configures terminal attributes, and duplicates the slave file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, effectively connecting the child process to the terminal.

The file includes necessary system headers for terminal control and process management, such as `<sys/types.h>`, `<sys/ioctl.h>`, and `<unistd.h>`, indicating its reliance on low-level system calls. The presence of the `fatal` and `fatalx` functions suggests error handling mechanisms, although their implementations are not provided in this snippet. This code is likely part of a larger library or application that deals with terminal management, and it does not define a public API or external interface by itself. Instead, it provides a utility function that can be used internally or by other components within the same project to manage pseudo-terminals effectively.

# Functions

### forkpty<!-- {{#callable:forkpty}} -->
The `forkpty` function creates a pseudo-terminal pair, forks a child process, and sets up the child process to use the slave side of the pseudo-terminal.
- **Inputs**:
    - `master`: A pointer to an integer where the file descriptor for the master side of the pseudo-terminal will be stored.
    - `name`: A character array where the name of the slave pseudo-terminal device will be copied, if not NULL.
    - `tio`: A pointer to a `struct termios` that contains terminal attributes to be set for the slave pseudo-terminal, if not NULL.
    - `ws`: A pointer to a `struct winsize` that contains window size attributes to be set for the slave pseudo-terminal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Open the master side of the pseudo-terminal using `/dev/ptmx` and store the file descriptor in `master`.
    - Grant access to the slave pseudo-terminal using `grantpt` and unlock it using `unlockpt`.
    - Retrieve the name of the slave pseudo-terminal using `ptsname` and copy it to `name` if `name` is not NULL.
    - Open the slave side of the pseudo-terminal using the retrieved name.
    - Fork the process; in the child process, close the master file descriptor, create a new session, and set the slave as the controlling terminal.
    - Set terminal attributes and window size for the slave if `tio` and `ws` are provided.
    - Redirect standard input, output, and error to the slave file descriptor and close the slave if it is greater than 2.
    - In the parent process, close the slave file descriptor and return the child's process ID.
    - If any error occurs during setup, close any open file descriptors and return -1.
- **Output**:
    - Returns the process ID of the child process in the parent, 0 in the child, or -1 on error.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`strlcpy`](strlcpy.c.driver.md#strlcpy)
    - [`fatal`](../log.c.driver.md#fatal)
