# Purpose
The provided code is a C header file, `bitstring.h`, which defines a set of macros for managing bitstrings. A bitstring is a sequence of bits that can be manipulated at the bit level, and this file provides a collection of macros to allocate, test, set, and clear bits within such a sequence. The file defines a type `bitstr_t` as an unsigned char, which serves as the basic unit for the bitstring operations. The macros include functionality for calculating the size of a bitstring (`bitstr_size`), allocating memory for a bitstring (`bit_alloc`), and performing bit-level operations such as testing if a bit is set (`bit_test`), setting a bit (`bit_set`), and clearing a bit (`bit_clear`). Additionally, it provides macros for setting and clearing ranges of bits (`bit_nset`, `bit_nclear`), and for finding the first clear or set bit in a bitstring (`bit_ffc`, `bit_ffs`).

This header file is designed to be included in other C programs that require efficient manipulation of bit-level data. It does not define any functions but instead uses macros to perform operations directly on bitstrings, which can lead to more efficient code by avoiding function call overhead. The file is part of the OpenBSD and NetBSD projects, as indicated by the versioning comments, and it includes a Berkeley-style license, allowing for broad use and modification. The macros are designed to be used externally, providing a public API for bitstring manipulation, and they rely on internal helper macros to calculate byte positions and bit masks. This file is a utility component that provides narrow, specialized functionality focused on bit-level data manipulation.
