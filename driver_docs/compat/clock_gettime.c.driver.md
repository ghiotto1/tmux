# Purpose
This C source code file provides an implementation of the [`clock_gettime`](#clock_gettime) function, which is typically used to retrieve the current time with high precision. The code includes a macro, `TIMEVAL_TO_TIMESPEC`, which converts a `timeval` structure (obtained from `gettimeofday`) to a `timespec` structure, allowing for compatibility with systems that may not natively support [`clock_gettime`](#clock_gettime). The function takes a `timespec` pointer as an argument and populates it with the current time, returning 0 to indicate success. This implementation is particularly useful for ensuring compatibility across different systems by providing a fallback for environments lacking native support for [`clock_gettime`](#clock_gettime).

# Functions

### clock_gettime<!-- {{#callable:clock_gettime}} -->
The `clock_gettime` function retrieves the current time and stores it in a `timespec` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `clock`: An integer representing the clock ID, which is unused in this implementation.
    - `ts`: A pointer to a `timespec` structure where the current time will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare a `struct timeval` variable `tv`.
    - Call `gettimeofday` to get the current time and store it in `tv`.
    - Convert the `timeval` structure `tv` to a `timespec` structure and store it in `ts` using the `TIMEVAL_TO_TIMESPEC` macro.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns 0 to indicate success, and the current time is stored in the `timespec` structure pointed to by `ts`.
