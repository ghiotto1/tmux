# Purpose
The provided C source code file implements functions for encoding and decoding data using the Base64 encoding scheme. This file is not an executable but rather a utility library that can be included in other C programs to provide Base64 functionality. The primary functions defined in this file are [`b64_ntop`](#b64_ntop) and [`b64_pton`](#b64_pton), which handle the conversion of binary data to Base64 encoded strings and vice versa. The [`b64_ntop`](#b64_ntop) function takes a source of binary data and encodes it into a Base64 string, while [`b64_pton`](#b64_pton) decodes a Base64 string back into binary data. These functions are designed to handle padding and whitespace appropriately, ensuring that the encoded and decoded data adhere to the Base64 specification as outlined in RFC 1521.

The code includes detailed comments explaining the Base64 encoding process, which involves converting 24-bit groups of input bits into 4 encoded characters using a 65-character subset of US-ASCII. The file also includes a static array `Base64` that defines the Base64 alphabet and a character `Pad64` for padding. The functions are implemented with error checking to handle cases where the input data does not align perfectly with the expected Base64 format, returning -1 in such cases to indicate an error. This file is a focused utility for Base64 encoding and decoding, making it a useful component for applications that need to handle data in this format, such as those involving data transmission over protocols that require text-based encoding.

# Global Variables

---
### Base64
- **Type**: ``const char[]``
- **Description**: The `Base64` variable is a constant character array that contains the 64-character set used in Base64 encoding. This set includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and the symbols '+' and '/'. It is used to map 6-bit binary sequences to printable characters in the Base64 encoding process.
- **Use**: This variable is used to encode binary data into a Base64 string by mapping 6-bit groups to corresponding characters in the array.


---
### Pad64
- **Type**: `char`
- **Description**: `Pad64` is a static constant character variable initialized with the '=' character. It is used as a padding character in Base64 encoding to ensure that the encoded output is a multiple of 4 characters.
- **Use**: `Pad64` is used in Base64 encoding to pad the output when the input data does not align perfectly with 24-bit groups.


# Functions

---
### b64_ntop<!-- {{#callable:b64_ntop}} -->
The `b64_ntop` function encodes binary data into a Base64 encoded string.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src`: A pointer to the input binary data to be encoded.
    - `srclength`: The length of the input binary data.
    - `target`: A pointer to the buffer where the Base64 encoded string will be stored.
    - `targsize`: The size of the target buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `datalength` to 0 and declare arrays `input` and `output` for processing data.
    - While there are more than 2 bytes left in `src`, read 3 bytes into `input`, decrement `srclength` by 3, and encode them into 4 Base64 characters stored in `output`.
    - Check if adding 4 characters to `target` would exceed `targsize`; if so, return -1.
    - Append the encoded characters from `output` to `target` and increment `datalength` by 4.
    - If there are remaining bytes in `src`, process them with padding: read remaining bytes into `input`, encode them, and append the result to `target` with appropriate padding using `=`.
    - Check if the final `datalength` exceeds `targsize`; if so, return -1.
    - Null-terminate the `target` string and return the length of the encoded data.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns the length of the Base64 encoded string, or -1 if an error occurs (e.g., if the target buffer is too small).


---
### b64_pton<!-- {{#callable:b64_pton}} -->
The `b64_pton` function decodes a Base64 encoded string into its original binary form, storing the result in a target buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src`: A pointer to the null-terminated string containing the Base64 encoded data.
    - `target`: A pointer to the buffer where the decoded binary data will be stored.
    - `targsize`: The size of the target buffer, indicating the maximum number of bytes it can hold.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `state` to 0 and `tarindex` to 0 to track the decoding state and the index in the target buffer.
    - Iterate over each character in the `src` string until a null character is encountered.
    - Skip any whitespace characters in the `src` string.
    - If a padding character '=' is encountered, break out of the loop to handle padding cases.
    - Find the position of the current character in the Base64 alphabet; if not found, return -1 indicating an error.
    - Use a switch statement to handle different states (0 to 3) of the decoding process, updating the target buffer with decoded bytes and managing the state transitions.
    - Check for buffer overflow by comparing `tarindex` with `targsize`, returning -1 if the buffer is exceeded.
    - After the loop, handle padding characters and ensure the input ends on a byte boundary, returning -1 if there are errors.
    - Return the number of bytes written to the target buffer if decoding is successful.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns the number of bytes stored in the target buffer, or -1 if an error occurs during decoding.
