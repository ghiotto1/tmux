# Purpose
The provided C source code file implements functions for encoding and decoding data using the Base64 encoding scheme. This file is not an executable but rather a utility library that can be included in other C programs to provide Base64 functionality. The two primary functions defined in this file are [`b64_ntop`](#b64_ntop) and [`b64_pton`](#b64_pton). The [`b64_ntop`](#b64_ntop) function encodes binary data into a Base64 string, while [`b64_pton`](#b64_pton) decodes a Base64 string back into binary data. These functions are designed to handle the conversion of data to and from a Base64 representation, which is a common requirement for encoding binary data in a text-based format, such as when embedding binary data in XML or JSON, or for email transmission.

The code adheres to the Base64 encoding rules as specified in RFC 1521, ensuring that the encoded data is represented using a 65-character subset of US-ASCII, with the '=' character used for padding. The file includes detailed comments explaining the encoding process, including how input bits are grouped and converted into Base64 characters. The functions handle various edge cases, such as input data that is not a multiple of 24 bits, by adding padding as necessary. The code also includes error handling to ensure that the target buffer is not overflowed and that only valid Base64 characters are processed. This file is a focused utility for Base64 encoding and decoding, providing a narrow but essential functionality for applications that need to handle data in this format.

# Global Variables

---
### Base64
- **Type**: ``char[]``
- **Description**: The `Base64` variable is a static constant character array that contains the 64-character Base64 alphabet used for encoding data. This alphabet includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and the '+' and '/' symbols, which are used to represent 6-bit groups in Base64 encoding.
- **Use**: This variable is used to map 6-bit binary sequences to their corresponding Base64 encoded characters during the encoding process.


---
### Pad64
- **Type**: `char`
- **Description**: The `Pad64` variable is a static constant character set to the '=' character. It is used in the Base64 encoding process to signify padding when the input data does not align perfectly with the 24-bit groups required for encoding.
- **Use**: `Pad64` is used to pad the output of the Base64 encoding process when the input data is not a multiple of 24 bits.


# Functions

---
### b64_ntop<!-- {{#callable:b64_ntop}} -->
The `b64_ntop` function encodes binary data into a Base64 string representation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src`: A pointer to the input binary data to be encoded.
    - `srclength`: The length of the input binary data in bytes.
    - `target`: A pointer to the buffer where the Base64 encoded string will be stored.
    - `targsize`: The size of the target buffer in bytes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `datalength` to 0 and declare arrays `input` and `output` for processing data in chunks.
    - While there are at least 3 bytes left in `src`, read 3 bytes into `input`, encode them into 4 Base64 characters stored in `output`, and append them to `target`.
    - Check if adding 4 characters to `target` would exceed `targsize`; if so, return -1 to indicate an error.
    - If there are 1 or 2 bytes left in `src`, pad `input` with zeros, encode the available bytes, and append the appropriate number of Base64 characters and padding to `target`.
    - Ensure the final `target` string is null-terminated and return the length of the encoded data, excluding the null terminator.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns the length of the Base64 encoded string, excluding the null terminator, or -1 if the target buffer is too small.


---
### b64_pton<!-- {{#callable:b64_pton}} -->
The `b64_pton` function decodes a Base64 encoded string into its original binary form, storing the result in a target buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `src`: A pointer to the null-terminated string containing the Base64 encoded data.
    - `target`: A pointer to the buffer where the decoded binary data will be stored.
    - `targsize`: The size of the target buffer, indicating the maximum number of bytes it can hold.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize state and target index to zero.
    - Iterate over each character in the source string until a null character is encountered.
    - Skip any whitespace characters in the source string.
    - If a padding character '=' is encountered, break the loop to handle padding cases.
    - Find the position of the current character in the Base64 alphabet; if not found, return -1 indicating an error.
    - Use a state machine with four states (0 to 3) to decode each set of four Base64 characters into three bytes of binary data.
    - In each state, calculate the appropriate byte value and store it in the target buffer, checking for buffer overflow.
    - After processing all characters, handle any padding characters and ensure no erroneous trailing characters exist.
    - Check for any partial bytes left unprocessed and return -1 if any are found.
    - Return the number of bytes written to the target buffer.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns the number of bytes successfully decoded and stored in the target buffer, or -1 if an error occurs during decoding.
