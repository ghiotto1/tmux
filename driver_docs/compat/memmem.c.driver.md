# Purpose
The provided C source code file implements a function named [`memmem`](#memmem), which is designed to locate the first occurrence of a byte string `s` within another byte string `l`. This function is a utility that extends the standard C library's string handling capabilities, specifically for raw memory areas, by providing a way to search for a sequence of bytes within a larger block of memory. The function takes four parameters: a pointer to the memory block `l`, the length of this block `l_len`, a pointer to the byte string `s` to be found, and the length of this byte string `s_len`. It returns a pointer to the first occurrence of `s` within `l`, or `NULL` if `s` is not found.

The code is structured to handle several edge cases efficiently, such as when the length of `s` is zero, in which case it returns the starting pointer of `l`, or when `s` is longer than `l`, returning `NULL`. It also optimizes for the scenario where `s` is a single byte by using the `memchr` function. The function iterates through the memory block `l` up to the last possible starting position where `s` could fit, checking for a match using `memcmp`. This implementation is a part of the OpenBSD project, as indicated by the header comments, and is distributed under a permissive license, allowing for broad reuse and modification. The inclusion of "compat.h" suggests that this file may be part of a compatibility layer, potentially providing this functionality on systems where it is not natively available.

# Functions

### memmem<!-- {{#callable:memmem}} -->
The `memmem` function searches for the first occurrence of a byte string `s` within another byte string `l`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `l`: A pointer to the byte string (haystack) in which to search.
    - `l_len`: The length of the byte string `l`.
    - `s`: A pointer to the byte string (needle) to search for within `l`.
    - `s_len`: The length of the byte string `s`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `s_len` is zero; if so, return the pointer to `l` as the needle is considered found at the start of the haystack.
    - Check if `l_len` is less than `s_len`; if so, return NULL as the needle cannot fit in the haystack.
    - If `s_len` is 1, use `memchr` to find the single character `s` in `l` and return the result.
    - Calculate the last possible starting position in `l` where `s` could fit, which is `l_len - s_len`.
    - Iterate over `l` from the start to the calculated last position, checking if the current position matches the start of `s` and if the subsequent bytes match using `memcmp`.
    - If a match is found, return the current position in `l` as a pointer.
    - If no match is found after the loop, return NULL.
- **Output**:
    - A pointer to the first occurrence of `s` in `l`, or NULL if `s` is not found.
