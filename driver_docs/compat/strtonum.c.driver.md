# Purpose
The provided C source code file defines a function named [`strtonum`](#strtonum), which is designed to convert a string representation of a number into a `long long` integer, while ensuring that the converted value falls within a specified range. This function is particularly useful for validating numeric input, as it not only performs the conversion but also checks for errors such as invalid input, values that are too small, or values that are too large. The function takes four parameters: the string to be converted (`numstr`), the minimum allowable value (`minval`), the maximum allowable value (`maxval`), and a pointer to a string (`errstrp`) that will be set to an error message if the conversion fails. The function returns the converted number if successful, or zero if an error occurs, with the error type indicated by setting the `errno` variable and the `errstrp` message.

This code provides a narrow but essential functionality, focusing on robust error handling and input validation for numeric conversions. It is a standalone utility function that can be integrated into larger programs where input validation is critical. The function uses standard library functions such as `strtoll` for the conversion process and checks the `errno` variable to determine if an overflow or underflow occurred. The inclusion of a custom error structure allows for clear communication of specific error conditions to the caller, enhancing the function's utility in applications that require precise error reporting.

# Data Structures

---
### errval
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `errstr`: A constant character pointer that holds the error string description.
    - `err`: An integer representing the error code associated with the error string.
- **Description**: The `errval` structure is used to represent error information, consisting of an error string and an associated error code. It is used in the `strtonum` function to map specific error conditions to human-readable strings and corresponding error codes, facilitating error handling and reporting.


# Functions

---
### strtonum<!-- {{#callable:strtonum}} -->
The `strtonum` function converts a string to a long long integer, ensuring it falls within a specified range and providing error feedback if it doesn't.
- **Inputs**:
    - `numstr`: A pointer to the string that represents the number to be converted.
    - `minval`: The minimum allowable value for the conversion result.
    - `maxval`: The maximum allowable value for the conversion result.
    - `errstrp`: A pointer to a string that will be set to an error message if the conversion fails.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a long long variable `ll` to 0, a char pointer `ep`, and an integer `error` to 0.
    - Define an array `ev` of structures to map error codes to error messages.
    - Store the current value of `errno` in `ev[0].err` and reset `errno` to 0.
    - Check if `minval` is greater than `maxval`; if so, set `error` to INVALID.
    - Use `strtoll` to attempt to convert `numstr` to a long long integer, storing the result in `ll` and the end pointer in `ep`.
    - If `numstr` is not a valid number or contains extra characters, set `error` to INVALID.
    - If the conversion result is less than `minval` or indicates an underflow, set `error` to TOOSMALL.
    - If the conversion result is greater than `maxval` or indicates an overflow, set `error` to TOOLARGE.
    - If `errstrp` is not NULL, set it to the error message corresponding to `error`.
    - Set `errno` to the error code corresponding to `error`.
    - If an error occurred, set `ll` to 0.
    - Return the value of `ll`.
- **Output**:
    - Returns the converted long long integer if successful, or 0 if an error occurred, with `errno` and `errstrp` providing error details.
