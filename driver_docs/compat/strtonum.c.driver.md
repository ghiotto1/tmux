# Purpose
The provided C source code file defines a function named [`strtonum`](#strtonum), which is designed to convert a string representation of a number into a `long long` integer, while also performing range validation. This function is particularly useful for ensuring that the converted number falls within a specified range, defined by `minval` and `maxval`. If the conversion is successful and the number is within the specified range, the function returns the converted number. If the conversion fails or the number is out of range, the function sets an error string and an error code to indicate the type of failure, such as "invalid", "too small", or "too large". This error information is communicated back to the caller through the `errstrp` pointer and the global `errno` variable.

The code is a standalone utility function that can be included in other C programs to provide robust string-to-number conversion with error handling. It does not define a public API or external interface beyond the [`strtonum`](#strtonum) function itself. The function uses standard C library functions like `strtoll` for the conversion process and checks for errors using the `errno` variable. The inclusion of a custom error structure allows for clear communication of specific error conditions, enhancing the usability of the function in larger applications. The file is likely intended to be part of a larger codebase, providing a reliable and reusable component for numeric string parsing.

# Data Structures

### errval
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `errstr`: A constant character pointer that holds the error string description.
    - `err`: An integer representing the error code associated with the error string.
- **Description**: The `errval` structure is used to represent error information, consisting of an error string and an associated error code. It is defined as an array of four elements, each corresponding to a specific error condition: no error, invalid input, input too small, and input too large. This structure is utilized within the `strtonum` function to provide detailed error feedback when converting a string to a number, allowing the function to communicate specific error conditions back to the caller.


# Functions

---
### strtonum<!-- {{#callable:strtonum}} -->
The `strtonum` function converts a string to a long long integer, ensuring it falls within a specified range and providing error feedback if it doesn't.
- **Inputs**:
    - `numstr`: A pointer to the string that represents the number to be converted.
    - `minval`: The minimum allowable value for the conversion result.
    - `maxval`: The maximum allowable value for the conversion result.
    - `errstrp`: A pointer to a string that will be set to an error message if the conversion fails.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a long long variable `ll` to 0 and a character pointer `ep` for error checking.
    - Set up an array of error values and messages for different error conditions.
    - Store the current value of `errno` in the first element of the error array and reset `errno` to 0.
    - Check if `minval` is greater than `maxval`; if so, set the error to INVALID.
    - Use `strtoll` to attempt to convert `numstr` to a long long integer, storing the result in `ll` and using `ep` to check for conversion errors.
    - If the conversion fails (i.e., `numstr` equals `ep` or `*ep` is not '\0'), set the error to INVALID.
    - If the converted value is less than `minval` or if `errno` indicates an underflow, set the error to TOOSMALL.
    - If the converted value is greater than `maxval` or if `errno` indicates an overflow, set the error to TOOLARGE.
    - If `errstrp` is not NULL, set it to the appropriate error message from the error array.
    - Restore `errno` to the error code corresponding to the detected error.
    - If an error was detected, set `ll` to 0 before returning.
- **Output**:
    - Returns the converted long long integer if successful, or 0 if an error occurred, with `errstrp` pointing to an error message if provided.
