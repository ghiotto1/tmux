# Purpose
The provided code is a C header file that defines a set of macros for managing various types of queue data structures. These include singly-linked lists, doubly-linked lists, simple queues, tail queues, and XOR simple queues. Each type of queue is implemented using macros that define the structure of the queue and provide functions for common operations such as initialization, insertion, removal, and traversal. The header file is designed to be included in other C programs, providing a standardized way to handle these data structures without the need for additional libraries.

The header file offers broad functionality by supporting multiple queue types, each suited for different use cases. Singly-linked lists and simple queues are optimized for minimal memory usage and are suitable for scenarios where elements are primarily added or removed from the head. Doubly-linked lists and tail queues allow for more flexible element removal and bidirectional traversal, making them ideal for more complex data management tasks. The XOR simple queue adds an additional layer of complexity by using XOR operations to obfuscate pointers, which can be useful for certain security or memory management applications. This file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but provides a robust internal mechanism for queue management in C programs.
# Global Variables

---
### le_prev
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `le_prev` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a struct type, used in the context of a doubly linked list. It holds the address of the previous element's next pointer, allowing for efficient removal and insertion operations in the list.
- **Use**: `le_prev` is used to maintain the linkage between elements in a doubly linked list, specifically to update the previous element's next pointer when an element is inserted or removed.


---
### sqh_last
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `sqh_last` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a structure of type `type`. It is used to store the address of the last element's next pointer in a simple queue data structure.
- **Use**: This variable is used to keep track of where the next element should be inserted in the queue, effectively pointing to the location where the next element's pointer will be stored.


---
### sqx_last
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `sqx_last` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a structure of type `type`. It is used to store the address of the last element's next pointer in an XOR simple queue. This allows for efficient insertion and removal operations at the tail of the queue.
- **Use**: `sqx_last` is used to track the end of an XOR simple queue, facilitating operations that modify the queue's tail.


---
### sqx_cookie
- **Type**: `unsigned long`
- **Description**: The `sqx_cookie` is a global variable of type `unsigned long` used in the XOR simple queue data structure. It acts as a 'cookie' that is XOR'd with queue pointers to generate real pointer values, providing a layer of obfuscation or protection for the pointers in the queue.
- **Use**: This variable is used to XOR with queue pointers to generate real pointer values in an XOR simple queue.


---
### tqh_last
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `tqh_last` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a struct type, used in the context of a tail queue data structure. It holds the address of the last element's next pointer, effectively pointing to the location where the next element would be added in the queue.
- **Use**: `tqh_last` is used to efficiently manage the insertion of new elements at the end of a tail queue.


---
### tqe_prev
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `tqe_prev` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a structure type, used in the context of a tail queue data structure. It holds the address of the previous element's next pointer, effectively linking the current element to the previous one in the queue.
- **Use**: This variable is used to maintain the backward linkage in a doubly-linked tail queue, allowing for efficient element removal and traversal in both directions.
