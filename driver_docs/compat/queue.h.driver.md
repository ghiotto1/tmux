# Purpose
The provided code is a C header file that defines a set of macros for managing various types of queue data structures. These include singly-linked lists, doubly-linked lists, simple queues, tail queues, and XOR simple queues. Each type of queue is implemented using macros that define the structure of the queue, methods for accessing elements, and functions for manipulating the queue, such as inserting and removing elements. The header file is designed to be included in other C programs to provide standardized and efficient implementations of these common data structures.

The header file offers broad functionality by providing a comprehensive suite of queue implementations, each tailored for different use cases. Singly-linked lists and simple queues are optimized for minimal memory usage and are suitable for scenarios where elements are primarily added or removed from the head. Doubly-linked lists and tail queues allow for more flexible element removal and traversal in both directions, making them suitable for more complex data management tasks. The XOR simple queue adds an additional layer of complexity by using XOR operations to obfuscate pointers, which can be useful for certain security or memory management applications. This file does not define a public API in the traditional sense but provides a set of macros that can be used to implement queue operations in a consistent and efficient manner across different C programs.
# Global Variables

---
### le_prev
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `le_prev` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a struct type, which holds the address of the previous element's next pointer in a doubly linked list. This allows for efficient removal and insertion operations in the list by maintaining a reference to the previous element's next pointer.
- **Use**: `le_prev` is used to facilitate the manipulation of elements in a doubly linked list by keeping track of the address of the previous element's next pointer.


---
### sqh_last
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `sqh_last` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a structure of type `type`. It is used to store the address of the last element's next pointer in a simple queue data structure.
- **Use**: This variable is used to efficiently manage the tail of a simple queue, allowing for quick insertions at the end of the queue.


---
### sqx_last
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `sqx_last` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a structure of type `type`. It is used to store the address of the last element's next pointer in an XOR simple queue, which is a data structure that uses XOR operations for pointer manipulation.
- **Use**: This variable is used to keep track of the position where new elements can be added at the end of the XOR simple queue.


---
### sqx_cookie
- **Type**: `unsigned long`
- **Description**: The `sqx_cookie` is a global variable of type `unsigned long` used in the definition of an XOR simple queue. It acts as a 'cookie' that is XOR'd with queue pointers to generate real pointer values, providing a layer of obfuscation or protection for the queue's internal pointers.
- **Use**: This variable is used to XOR with queue pointers to generate real pointer values in an XOR simple queue.


---
### tqh_last
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `tqh_last` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a structure type, specifically used in the context of a tail queue data structure. It holds the address of the last element's next pointer, effectively pointing to the location where the next element would be added in the queue.
- **Use**: `tqh_last` is used to efficiently manage the insertion of new elements at the end of a tail queue.


---
### tqe_prev
- **Type**: `struct type **`
- **Description**: The `tqe_prev` variable is a pointer to a pointer of a struct type, used in the context of a tail queue data structure. It holds the address of the previous element's next pointer, effectively linking elements in a doubly-linked list.
- **Use**: `tqe_prev` is used to maintain the backward link in a tail queue, allowing for efficient removal and insertion of elements.
