# Purpose
This file is a C header file, `vis.h`, which provides function declarations and macro definitions for encoding and decoding strings in a visually safe manner. The macros define various flags that control the encoding behavior, such as using octal representation (`VIS_OCTAL`), encoding whitespace characters (`VIS_WHITE`), and handling special characters like double quotes (`VIS_DQ`). The header also defines return codes for the `unvis` function, which is used to decode encoded strings, indicating the status of the decoding process. The functions declared, such as `vis`, `strvis`, and `unvis`, are used to convert strings into a format that is safe for visual display, particularly useful for encoding non-printable or special characters in a way that can be safely printed or logged. This header is part of the OpenBSD and NetBSD projects, as indicated by the version control comments at the top.

### vis
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `vis` function is a global function that takes four parameters: a character pointer, and three integers. It is part of a library for encoding characters into a visual representation, often used to make non-printable characters visible in a safe manner.
- **Use**: This function is used to encode characters into a visual format, typically for display or logging purposes.
