# Purpose
This C source code file provides a function named [`daemon`](#daemon), which is designed to transform a running process into a daemon process. A daemon process is a background process that is detached from the controlling terminal and runs independently of user interaction. The function achieves this by performing several key operations: it forks the process to create a child process, terminates the parent process, creates a new session with `setsid` to detach from the terminal, optionally changes the working directory to the root directory, and redirects standard input, output, and error streams to `/dev/null` to prevent any terminal I/O. The function also includes a conditional compilation block for macOS systems, where it calls an external function [`daemon_darwin`](#daemon_darwin) to handle any platform-specific requirements.

The code is part of a broader library or system utility, as indicated by its inclusion of a custom header file "compat.h" and its adherence to a BSD-style license. The function is not an executable on its own but is intended to be used as part of a larger application or system that requires daemonization capabilities. The presence of conditional compilation for macOS suggests that the code is designed to be portable across different Unix-like operating systems. The function does not define a public API or external interface beyond the [`daemon`](#daemon) function itself, which is a standard utility function in Unix-like systems for process management.

# Functions

### daemon<!-- {{#callable:daemon}} -->
The `daemon` function transforms a process into a daemon by forking, creating a new session, optionally changing the working directory to root, and redirecting standard file descriptors to `/dev/null`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `nochdir`: An integer flag that, if non-zero, prevents the function from changing the current working directory to the root directory ('/').
    - `noclose`: An integer flag that, if non-zero, prevents the function from redirecting standard input, output, and error file descriptors to `/dev/null`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by forking the process.
    - If the fork fails, it returns -1.
    - If the fork succeeds, the parent process exits immediately, and the child process continues.
    - The child process creates a new session using `setsid()`. If this fails, it returns -1.
    - If `nochdir` is zero, the function changes the current working directory to the root directory ('/').
    - If `noclose` is zero, the function opens `/dev/null` and redirects standard input, output, and error to this file descriptor.
    - If the file descriptor opened for `/dev/null` is greater than 2, it closes the file descriptor.
    - On Apple systems, it calls `daemon_darwin()` to perform additional platform-specific operations.
    - Finally, the function returns 0 to indicate success.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns 0 on success, or -1 if an error occurs during forking or session creation.
