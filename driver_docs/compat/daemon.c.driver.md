# Purpose
This C source code file provides a function named [`daemon`](#daemon), which is designed to transform a process into a daemon process. A daemon process is a background process that is detached from the controlling terminal and runs independently of user interaction. The function achieves this by forking the process, creating a new session with `setsid()`, optionally changing the working directory to the root directory, and redirecting standard input, output, and error streams to `/dev/null` to prevent any terminal I/O. The function also includes conditional compilation for macOS systems, where it calls an external function `daemon_darwin()` to handle any platform-specific requirements for daemonizing a process on that operating system.

The code is a standalone implementation intended to be used as part of a larger system or application that requires daemon functionality. It is not a complete executable on its own but rather a utility function that can be integrated into other programs. The file includes necessary headers for system calls and file operations, and it adheres to the BSD license, allowing for broad use and modification under specified conditions. The function provides a narrow but essential functionality, focusing solely on the process of daemonization, which is a common requirement for server applications and background services.

# Functions

---
### daemon<!-- {{#callable:daemon}} -->
The `daemon` function transforms a process into a daemon by forking, creating a new session, optionally changing the working directory to root, and redirecting standard file descriptors to `/dev/null`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `nochdir`: An integer flag that, if non-zero, prevents the function from changing the current working directory to the root directory ('/').
    - `noclose`: An integer flag that, if non-zero, prevents the function from redirecting standard input, output, and error file descriptors to `/dev/null`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by forking the current process.
    - If the fork fails, it returns -1.
    - If the fork succeeds, the parent process exits immediately with `_exit(0)`, while the child process continues.
    - The child process calls `setsid()` to start a new session and detach from any terminal.
    - If `setsid()` fails, the function returns -1.
    - If `nochdir` is zero, the function changes the current working directory to the root directory ('/').
    - If `noclose` is zero, the function opens `/dev/null` and redirects standard input, output, and error to it using `dup2`.
    - If the file descriptor for `/dev/null` is greater than 2, it closes the file descriptor.
    - On Apple systems, it calls `daemon_darwin()` for additional platform-specific behavior.
    - Finally, the function returns 0 to indicate success.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
