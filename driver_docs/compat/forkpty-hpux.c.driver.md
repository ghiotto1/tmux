# Purpose
This C source code file provides a specific functionality related to pseudo-terminal (PTY) management, specifically implementing a [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function. The [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function is designed to create a new pseudo-terminal pair, fork a child process, and establish the child process's terminal settings. This function is particularly useful in applications that require terminal emulation or need to manage terminal I/O for subprocesses, such as terminal multiplexers or remote shell applications. The code includes system calls and terminal control operations to handle the creation and configuration of the PTY, including setting terminal attributes and window size.

The file includes necessary headers for system types, I/O control, and terminal operations, indicating its reliance on low-level system interfaces. The function [`forkpty`](#forkpty) is the primary component, encapsulating the logic for PTY creation and process forking. It handles error conditions gracefully by cleaning up resources before returning. The presence of `fatal` and `fatalx` function declarations suggests that these are used for error handling, although their implementations are not included in this snippet. This code is likely part of a larger library or application that deals with terminal management, and it does not define a public API or external interface on its own, but rather provides a utility function for internal use.

# Functions

---
### forkpty<!-- {{#callable:forkpty}} -->
The `forkpty` function creates a pseudo-terminal pair, forks a new process, and sets up the child process to use the slave side of the pseudo-terminal.
- **Inputs**:
    - `master`: A pointer to an integer where the file descriptor for the master side of the pseudo-terminal will be stored.
    - `name`: A character array where the name of the slave pseudo-terminal device will be copied, if not NULL.
    - `tio`: A pointer to a `struct termios` that contains terminal attributes to be set for the slave pseudo-terminal, if not NULL.
    - `ws`: A pointer to a `struct winsize` that contains window size attributes to be set for the slave pseudo-terminal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Open the master side of the pseudo-terminal using `/dev/ptmx` and store the file descriptor in `master`.
    - Grant access to the slave pseudo-terminal using `grantpt` and unlock it using `unlockpt`.
    - Retrieve the name of the slave pseudo-terminal using `ptsname` and copy it to `name` if `name` is not NULL.
    - Open the slave side of the pseudo-terminal using the retrieved name.
    - Fork the process; in the child process, close the master file descriptor, create a new session, and set the controlling terminal if `TIOCSCTTY` is defined.
    - Push the `ptem` and `ldterm` modules onto the slave side of the pseudo-terminal using `ioctl`.
    - Set terminal attributes using `tcsetattr` if `tio` is not NULL, and set window size using `ioctl`.
    - Redirect standard input, output, and error to the slave file descriptor and close it if it is greater than 2.
    - In the parent process, close the slave file descriptor and return the child's process ID.
    - If any error occurs, close any open file descriptors and return -1.
- **Output**:
    - Returns the process ID of the child process in the parent, 0 in the child, or -1 on error.
