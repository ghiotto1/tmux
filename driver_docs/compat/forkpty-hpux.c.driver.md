# Purpose
This C source code file provides a specific functionality related to pseudo-terminal (PTY) management, specifically implementing a [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function. The [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function is designed to create a new pseudo-terminal pair, fork a child process, and establish the child process's terminal settings. This function is particularly useful in terminal emulation and process management scenarios, where a program needs to interact with a terminal device programmatically. The code includes system calls and library functions to open a master PTY, grant access, unlock it, and obtain the corresponding slave PTY. It then forks a new process, setting up the terminal environment for the child process, including terminal attributes and window size, and redirects standard input, output, and error to the slave PTY.

The file includes necessary headers for system types, input/output control, and terminal handling, indicating its reliance on low-level system operations. The presence of the [`fatal`](#fatal) and [`fatalx`](#fatalx) functions, although not defined in this snippet, suggests error handling mechanisms for critical failures. This code is likely part of a larger library or application that requires terminal emulation or process control capabilities, and it does not define a public API or external interface by itself. Instead, it provides a focused utility function that can be integrated into broader systems requiring PTY management.

# Functions

---
### forkpty<!-- {{#callable:forkpty}} -->
The `forkpty` function creates a pseudo-terminal pair, forks a new process, and sets up the terminal environment for the child process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `master`: A pointer to an integer where the file descriptor for the master side of the pseudo-terminal will be stored.
    - `name`: A character array where the name of the slave pseudo-terminal device will be copied, if not NULL.
    - `tio`: A pointer to a `struct termios` that contains terminal attributes to be set for the slave terminal, if not NULL.
    - `ws`: A pointer to a `struct winsize` that contains window size attributes to be set for the slave terminal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Open the master side of the pseudo-terminal using `/dev/ptmx` and store the file descriptor in `master`.
    - Grant access to the slave pseudo-terminal using `grantpt` and unlock it using `unlockpt`.
    - Retrieve the name of the slave pseudo-terminal using `ptsname` and copy it to `name` if `name` is not NULL.
    - Open the slave side of the pseudo-terminal using the retrieved name.
    - Fork the process; in the child process, close the master file descriptor, create a new session, and set the controlling terminal if `TIOCSCTTY` is defined.
    - Push terminal modules `ptem` and `ldterm` onto the slave file descriptor using `ioctl`.
    - Set terminal attributes using `tcsetattr` if `tio` is not NULL, and set window size using `ioctl`.
    - Redirect standard input, output, and error to the slave file descriptor and close it if it is greater than 2.
    - In the parent process, close the slave file descriptor and return the child's process ID.
    - If any error occurs, close any open file descriptors and return -1.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns the process ID of the child process to the parent, 0 to the child process, or -1 on error.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fatal<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fatal}} -->
Logs a fatal error message and terminates the program.
- **Description**: This function is used to log a critical error message and immediately terminate the program. It should be called when an unrecoverable error occurs, and the program cannot continue execution. The function formats the error message using a printf-style format string and additional arguments, appending the current error string from errno. It then logs the message and exits the program with a status code of 1. This function does not return, and any resources held by the program will not be released unless handled by the operating system.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A printf-style format string that describes the error. It must not be null and should be a valid format string. Additional arguments should match the format specifiers in this string.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fatal`](../log.c.driver.md#fatal)  (Implementation)


---
### fatalx<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fatalx}} -->
Logs a fatal error message and terminates the program.
- **Description**: Use this function to log a critical error message and immediately terminate the program. It is intended for situations where continuing execution is not possible or safe. The function formats the error message using a printf-style format string followed by additional arguments. It is important to ensure that the format string and arguments are valid to avoid undefined behavior. This function does not return, as it calls exit with a status of 1 after logging the message.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A printf-style format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output. Must not be null. The format string should be valid and correspond to the provided arguments to avoid undefined behavior.
    - `...`: Additional arguments that are formatted according to the format string. The number and types of these arguments must match the format specifiers in the format string.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fatalx`](../log.c.driver.md#fatalx)  (Implementation)
