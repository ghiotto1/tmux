# Purpose
This C source code file provides a specific functionality related to pseudo-terminal (PTY) management, specifically implementing a [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function. The [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function is designed to create a new pseudo-terminal pair, fork a new process, and establish the child process's standard input, output, and error streams to the slave side of the PTY. This is a common requirement in terminal emulation and process control applications, where a program needs to interact with a terminal-like interface programmatically. The function handles the creation of the PTY master and slave, manages process forking, and sets up the terminal attributes and window size for the slave terminal, ensuring that the child process operates in a new session and is detached from any controlling terminal.

The code includes several system headers for terminal and process control, such as `<sys/types.h>`, `<sys/ioctl.h>`, and `<stropts.h>`, indicating its reliance on system-level operations. It also includes a custom header `"compat.h"`, which likely provides compatibility definitions or functions. The [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function is a critical component for applications that require terminal emulation, such as terminal multiplexers or remote shell utilities. It does not define a public API or external interface beyond the [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function itself, which is intended to be used internally or by other components of a larger system that require PTY management. The presence of error handling through `fatal` and `fatalx` functions suggests a robust approach to managing system call failures, ensuring that the function can gracefully handle errors during PTY setup and process management.

# Functions

---
### forkpty<!-- {{#callable:forkpty}} -->
The `forkpty` function creates a pseudo-terminal pair, forks a child process, and sets up the child process to use the slave side of the pseudo-terminal.
- **Inputs**:
    - `master`: A pointer to an integer where the file descriptor for the master side of the pseudo-terminal will be stored.
    - `name`: An unused character pointer intended to store the name of the slave side of the pseudo-terminal, if not NULL.
    - `tio`: A pointer to a `termios` structure for setting terminal attributes on the slave side, if not NULL.
    - `ws`: A pointer to a `winsize` structure for setting the window size of the slave side, if not NULL.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a pipe for synchronization between parent and child processes.
    - Open the master side of the pseudo-terminal and store its file descriptor in `master`.
    - Retrieve the name of the slave side of the pseudo-terminal and copy it to `name` if `name` is not NULL.
    - Open the slave side of the pseudo-terminal.
    - Fork the process; in the child process, close the master file descriptor and synchronize with the parent using the pipe.
    - In the child process, disconnect from the controlling terminal, create a new session, and open the slave side of the pseudo-terminal.
    - Set terminal attributes and window size on the slave side if `tio` and `ws` are provided.
    - Redirect standard input, output, and error to the slave side of the pseudo-terminal.
    - Close unnecessary file descriptors and return 0 in the child process.
    - In the parent process, close the slave file descriptor and the pipe, and return the child's PID.
- **Output**:
    - Returns the process ID of the child process to the parent, and 0 to the child process; returns -1 on error.
