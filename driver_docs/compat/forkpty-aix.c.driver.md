# Purpose
This C source code file provides a specific functionality related to pseudo-terminal (PTY) management, specifically implementing a [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function. The [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function is designed to create a new pseudo-terminal pair, fork a new process, and establish the child process's standard input, output, and error streams to the slave side of the PTY. This is a common requirement in terminal emulation and process management applications, where a program needs to interact with a terminal-like interface programmatically. The function handles the creation of the PTY master and slave, manages process forking, and sets up the terminal attributes and window size for the slave terminal, ensuring that the child process operates in a new session and is detached from any controlling terminal.

The code includes essential system headers for terminal and process control, such as `<sys/types.h>`, `<sys/ioctl.h>`, and `<stropts.h>`, indicating its reliance on system-level operations. It also includes a custom header `"compat.h"`, which likely provides compatibility functions or definitions. The [`forkpty`](#forkpty) function is a critical component for applications that require terminal emulation or need to run subprocesses with terminal-like behavior, such as terminal multiplexers or remote shell applications. The function is robustly designed to handle errors gracefully, ensuring that resources are properly closed in case of failure, and it uses helper functions [`fatal`](#fatal) and [`fatalx`](#fatalx) for error reporting, which are declared but not defined in this file, suggesting they are part of a larger codebase.

# Functions

---
### forkpty<!-- {{#callable:forkpty}} -->
The `forkpty` function creates a pseudo-terminal pair, forks a new process, and sets up the child process to use the slave side of the pseudo-terminal as its controlling terminal.
- **Inputs**:
    - `master`: A pointer to an integer where the file descriptor for the master side of the pseudo-terminal will be stored.
    - `name`: An unused character pointer intended to store the name of the slave pseudo-terminal device, if not NULL.
    - `tio`: A pointer to a `struct termios` that contains terminal attributes to be set on the slave side of the pseudo-terminal.
    - `ws`: A pointer to a `struct winsize` that contains window size attributes to be set on the slave side of the pseudo-terminal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a pipe for inter-process communication and check for errors.
    - Open the master side of the pseudo-terminal and store its file descriptor in `master`.
    - Retrieve the name of the slave pseudo-terminal and optionally copy it to `name`.
    - Open the slave side of the pseudo-terminal and check for errors.
    - Fork the process and handle errors.
    - In the child process, close the master file descriptor and synchronize with the parent using the pipe.
    - Detach from the controlling terminal and create a new session.
    - Open the slave pseudo-terminal and set terminal attributes and window size if provided.
    - Redirect standard input, output, and error to the slave pseudo-terminal.
    - In the parent process, close the slave file descriptor and the pipe, and return the child's process ID.
- **Output**:
    - Returns the process ID of the child process to the parent, and 0 to the child process; returns -1 on error.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fatal<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fatal}} -->
Logs a fatal error message and terminates the program.
- **Description**: Use this function to log a critical error message and immediately terminate the program. It is intended for situations where continuing execution is not possible or safe. The function formats the error message using a printf-style format string and additional arguments, similar to printf. It appends a description of the current errno value to the message. This function does not return, as it calls exit(1) after logging the message. Ensure that any necessary cleanup is performed before calling this function, as it will not return control to the caller.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A printf-style format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output. Must not be null. The format string should be a valid C string.
    - `...`: Additional arguments that are formatted according to the format string specified by 'msg'. The number and types of these arguments must match the format specifiers in 'msg'.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fatal`](../log.c.driver.md#fatal)  (Implementation)


---
### fatalx<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fatalx}} -->
Terminates the program after logging a formatted fatal error message.
- **Description**: Use this function to log a critical error message and immediately terminate the program. It is intended for situations where continuing execution is not possible or safe. The function logs the provided message with a 'fatal: ' prefix, using a format string and additional arguments similar to printf. After logging, the function exits the program with a status code of 1. This function does not return, and any resources not explicitly released before calling this function will not be cleaned up.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A format string for the error message, similar to printf. It must not be null and should be a valid format string. The caller retains ownership.
    - `...`: Additional arguments to be formatted into the message, matching the format specifiers in 'msg'. The number and types of these arguments must correspond to the format string.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fatalx`](../log.c.driver.md#fatalx)  (Implementation)
