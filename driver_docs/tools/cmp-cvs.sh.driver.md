# Purpose
This script is a shell script written for the KornShell (ksh) environment, providing a narrow functionality focused on comparing source code files. It iterates over all files with `.c` and `.h` extensions in the current directory, comparing each file to its counterpart in the `/usr/src/usr.bin/tmux/` directory using the `diff` command. The script filters out lines containing the string `'$OpenBSD'` and appends the differences to a file named `diff.out`, unless the difference output is exactly 8 lines long, in which case it skips appending. This script is likely used for maintaining or auditing changes in source code files against a reference implementation, specifically for the `tmux` project, and is not intended to be a standalone executable or a library but rather a utility for developers.
