# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to demonstrate the use of 24-bit color codes in a terminal environment by generating and displaying four different color gradients. The script utilizes ANSI escape sequences to manipulate the background color of the terminal output. It defines functions to set the background color and reset the terminal output to its default state. The script also includes a function, `rainbowColor`, which calculates RGB values based on a given position along the HSV color spectrum, allowing for the creation of a rainbow gradient.

The script begins by determining the appropriate sequence command (`seq` or `gseq`) to use for generating numerical sequences, which are essential for iterating over color values. It then defines a custom function, `seq1`, to handle both ascending and descending sequences, ensuring compatibility with GNU `seq`. The script proceeds to generate gradients by iterating over a range of values, setting the background color for each step, and printing a space character to visualize the gradient. This process is repeated for red, green, blue, and rainbow gradients.

Overall, this script provides a focused functionality, specifically for visualizing color gradients in a terminal. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as its primary purpose is to serve as a demonstration tool for terminal color capabilities. The script is a standalone executable that can be run directly in a compatible terminal environment to observe the effects of 24-bit color codes.
# Global Variables

---
### SEQ1
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: SEQ1 is a global variable that is used to determine the command for generating sequences of numbers. It is initially set to an empty string and then conditionally assigned either 'gseq' or 'seq' based on the availability of these commands in the system. This variable is crucial for the script's functionality as it dictates how sequences are generated for color gradients.
- **Use**: SEQ1 is used to store the command name for generating number sequences, which is then utilized in the seq1 function to create gradients.


---
### SEQ
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `SEQ` variable is a global variable that is assigned a function name based on the availability of certain sequence-generating commands in the system. It is set to either `seq1`, a custom function defined in the script, or `seq`, a standard command, depending on the presence of GNU `seq` or `gseq`.
- **Use**: This variable is used to generate sequences of numbers for iterating over color values in the script.


---
### SEPARATOR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `SEPARATOR` variable is a global string variable that holds the character ':' (colon). It is used as a delimiter in the escape sequences for setting background colors in the terminal. This variable helps in constructing the escape sequences by separating different components of the sequence, such as the color values.
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct escape sequences for setting terminal background colors by acting as a delimiter between components.


# Functions

---
### seq1
The `seq1` function generates a sequence of numbers between two given integers, either in ascending or descending order, depending on their values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `$1`: The starting integer of the sequence.
    - `$2`: The ending integer of the sequence.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the first argument $1 is greater than the second argument $2.
    - If $1 is greater than $2, use the command stored in SEQ1 to generate a sequence from $1 to $2 with a decrement of 1.
    - If $1 is less than or equal to $2, use the command stored in SEQ1 to generate a sequence from $1 to $2 with an increment of 1.
- **Output**:
    - The function outputs a sequence of numbers from $1 to $2, either in ascending or descending order, depending on the values of $1 and $2.


---
### setBackgroundColor
The `setBackgroundColor` function sets the terminal's background color using 24-bit RGB color codes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `$1`: The red component of the RGB color, an integer between 0 and 255.
    - `$2`: The green component of the RGB color, an integer between 0 and 255.
    - `$3`: The blue component of the RGB color, an integer between 0 and 255.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function constructs an escape sequence string for setting the background color using the provided RGB values.
    - It uses the escape sequence format '\033[48;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m' where <r>, <g>, and <b> are replaced by the input RGB values.
    - The constructed escape sequence is then echoed to the terminal with the '-en' option to enable interpretation of backslash escapes and to suppress the trailing newline.
- **Output**:
    - The function outputs an escape sequence to the terminal that changes the background color to the specified RGB values.


---
### resetOutput
The `resetOutput` function resets the terminal's output to its default settings by sending an escape sequence.
- **Inputs**:
    - None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the `echo` command with the `-en` flags to send an escape sequence to the terminal.
    - The escape sequence `\033[0m` is used to reset the terminal's output settings.
    - A newline character is appended to the escape sequence to move the cursor to the next line.
- **Output**:
    - The function outputs an escape sequence that resets the terminal's output to its default settings, followed by a newline.


---
### rainbowColor
The `rainbowColor` function calculates RGB color values based on a given position along the HSV color wheel, specifically for values between 0 and 255.
- **Inputs**:
    - `$1`: An integer representing a position along the HSV color wheel, expected to be between 0 and 255.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the hue segment `h` by dividing the input by 43.
    - Calculate the fractional part `f` by subtracting 43 times `h` from the input.
    - Calculate `t` as the fractional part scaled to 255 by multiplying `f` by 255 and dividing by 43.
    - Calculate `q` as 255 minus `t`.
    - Use a series of conditional statements to determine the RGB values based on the value of `h`.
    - Output the RGB values as a string in the format "red green blue".
- **Output**:
    - A string containing three space-separated integers representing the red, green, and blue components of the color, each ranging from 0 to 255.
