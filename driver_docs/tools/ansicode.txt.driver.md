# Purpose
The provided content is a comprehensive document detailing the ANSI standards for ASCII terminals, specifically focusing on the VT100 terminal emulation and related ANSI standards such as X3.64-1979. This document serves as a reference guide for understanding the control sequences, escape sequences, and character sets used in terminal emulation, which are crucial for software that interacts with terminal hardware or emulators. It provides a detailed breakdown of control characters, escape sequences, and their interpretations, which are essential for developers working on terminal emulation software or applications that need to communicate with terminals using these standards. The document is organized into sections that cover various aspects of terminal control, including character classifications, control sequences, and emulation requirements, making it a vital resource for ensuring compatibility and functionality in terminal-based applications.
# Content Summary
This document, titled "Summary of ANSI standards for ASCII terminals" by Joe Smith, dated May 18, 1984, provides a comprehensive overview of ANSI standards related to ASCII terminals, particularly focusing on the VT100 terminal emulation. It serves as a detailed reference for developers working with terminal emulation, providing a numeric order listing of ANSI escape sequences and control codes, which are typically presented alphabetically in other guides.

The document is structured into several sections, each detailing different aspects of ANSI standards:

1. **Overview and Definitions**: It introduces key concepts such as control characters, escape sequences, and control sequences, explaining their roles and how they are structured. Control characters are single characters with specific ASCII codes, while escape sequences are strings starting with the ESC character. Control sequences begin with a Control Sequence Introducer (CSI) and are terminated by an alphabetic character.

2. **Control Codes and Sequences**: The document lists C0 and C1 control codes, two and three-character escape sequences, and control sequences in numeric order. It explains the function of each code and sequence, providing examples of their use in terminal operations. For instance, C0 control codes include basic operations like NUL (null filler) and BEL (bell), while C1 codes include more advanced functions like IND (index) and NEL (new line).

3. **VT100 Emulation Requirements**: This section outlines the minimum requirements for a terminal to emulate a VT100, including cursor movement commands, screen clearing functions, and character attribute settings. It also details the necessary keyboard inputs and outputs for full-screen editing and data entry in VT100 mode.

4. **Character Set Selection and Private Sequences**: The document describes how to select different character sets using escape sequences and provides examples of private two-character escape sequences that can be defined by terminal manufacturers.

5. **Control Sequences with Intermediate Characters**: It includes sequences that involve intermediate characters, which are used for more complex terminal operations like scrolling and graphic size modification.

Overall, this document is an essential resource for developers working with terminal emulation, providing a detailed and organized reference to ANSI standards and their implementation in ASCII terminals, particularly the VT100. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these standards for creating consistent and functional terminal interfaces.
