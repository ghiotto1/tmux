# Purpose
The provided content is a comprehensive document detailing the ANSI standards for ASCII terminals, specifically focusing on the interpretation and implementation of control and escape sequences for terminal emulation, such as the VT100. This document serves as a reference guide for developers and engineers working with terminal emulation software, providing detailed descriptions of control characters, escape sequences, and control sequences as defined by various ANSI standards (X3.4-1977, X3.41-1974, and X3.64-1979). It categorizes and explains the functionality of these sequences, which are essential for ensuring compatibility and proper behavior of terminal emulators. The document is crucial for understanding how to implement or emulate terminal features like cursor movement, screen clearing, and character set selection, which are fundamental for applications that rely on text-based user interfaces. This file is relevant to a codebase as it provides the necessary specifications and guidelines for implementing terminal emulation features that adhere to established standards, ensuring interoperability and consistency across different systems and applications.
# Content Summary
The document titled "Summary of ANSI standards for ASCII terminals" by Joe Smith, dated 18-May-84, provides a comprehensive overview of ANSI standards related to ASCII terminals, particularly focusing on the VT100 terminal emulation. It consolidates definitions and rules from three key ANSI standards: X3.4-1977, X3.41-1974, and X3.64-1979, organizing them in numeric order for ease of reference.

The document is structured into several sections, each detailing different aspects of ANSI standards:

1. **Overview and Definitions**: This section introduces the basic concepts and definitions necessary for understanding ANSI standards, such as control characters, escape sequences, and control sequences. It explains the ASCII character set, including the 7-bit (C0 and G0) and 8-bit (C1 and G1) character sets, and the rationale behind their design.

2. **General Rules for Interpreting Sequences**: It outlines the rules for interpreting escape sequences and control sequences, which are crucial for terminal operations. Escape sequences start with the ESC character and vary in length based on the following character, while control sequences begin with the CSI character and end with an alphabetic character.

3. **Control Codes and Sequences**: The document lists C0 and C1 control codes, two and three-character escape sequences, and control sequences in numeric order. It provides detailed descriptions of each code and sequence, including their functions and usage in DEC VT series or LA series terminals.

4. **Character Classifications**: It categorizes ASCII characters into control, displayable, and special characters, providing their octal and hexadecimal ranges.

5. **VT100 Emulation Requirements**: This section specifies the minimum requirements for VT100 terminal emulation, including cursor commands, erase commands, and character attributes. It also covers the necessary functionalities for data entry, full-screen editing, and handling of double-width/double-height lines.

6. **Private and Standard Sequences**: The document details private two-character escape sequences and control sequences, which can be defined differently by terminal manufacturers, and standard sequences defined by ANSI X3.64-1979.

The document serves as a vital reference for developers working with ASCII terminals, providing essential technical details for implementing and understanding terminal emulation and control sequences. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to ANSI standards for consistent terminal behavior and interoperability.
