# Purpose
This Perl script is designed to demonstrate the 256-color capabilities of terminal emulators, specifically focusing on the color palette used in xterm. The script generates and displays a range of colors, including the standard system colors, a 6x6x6 color cube, and a grayscale ramp. The script is structured to first define the colors and then visually display them in the terminal, providing a clear representation of how each color is rendered.

The script begins by defining colors 0-15, which are typically the standard ANSI colors, though they may be customized to more aesthetically pleasing shades. It then proceeds to define colors 16-231, which form a 6x6x6 color cube, allowing for a wide range of color combinations by varying the red, green, and blue components. Finally, colors 232-255 are defined as a grayscale ramp, excluding pure black and white to focus on intermediate shades.

The script is not intended to be a reusable library or a component of a larger application but rather serves as a standalone demonstration tool. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as its primary purpose is to output color sequences directly to the terminal for visualization. This makes it a useful utility for developers and users who need to understand or test the color capabilities of their terminal environments.
