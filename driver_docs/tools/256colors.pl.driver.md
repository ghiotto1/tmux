# Purpose
This Perl script is designed to demonstrate the 256-color capabilities of terminal emulators that support extended color palettes. It systematically defines and displays a range of colors, including standard system colors, a 6x6x6 color cube, and a grayscale ramp. The script is structured to first define the colors using ANSI escape codes and then visually display them in the terminal, providing a comprehensive view of the available color spectrum.

The script begins by defining colors 0-15, which typically correspond to the standard ANSI colors, though they may be customized to more aesthetically pleasing shades. It then constructs a 6x6x6 color cube for colors 16-231, where each color is a combination of varying intensities of red, green, and blue. This is achieved through nested loops that calculate the appropriate RGB values and assign them to the corresponding color index. Following this, the script defines a grayscale ramp for colors 232-255, excluding pure black and white, by incrementing the intensity level in steps to create a smooth gradient.

Finally, the script outputs these colors to the terminal. It first prints the system colors, followed by the color cube, and concludes with the grayscale ramp. Each color is displayed as a block of color using the background color escape sequence, allowing users to visually inspect the full range of colors supported by their terminal. This script serves as a useful tool for developers and users who need to understand or utilize the extended color capabilities of their terminal environments.
