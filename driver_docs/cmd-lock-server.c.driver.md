# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux project, a terminal multiplexer that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. The file defines and implements commands related to locking various components of the tmux environment, specifically the server, sessions, and clients. The primary functionality is encapsulated in the [`cmd_lock_server_exec`](#cmd_lock_server_exec) function, which executes the appropriate locking mechanism based on the command entry it is associated with. The file includes three command entries: `cmd_lock_server_entry`, `cmd_lock_session_entry`, and `cmd_lock_client_entry`, each corresponding to locking the server, a session, or a client, respectively.

Each command entry is defined with a name, alias, argument specifications, usage information, and execution flags. The [`cmd_lock_server_exec`](#cmd_lock_server_exec) function is the core execution function that determines which locking function to call—`server_lock`, `server_lock_session`, or `server_lock_client`—based on the command entry. This file is a part of the broader tmux command infrastructure, providing specific functionality for security and session management by allowing users to lock different components of their tmux environment. The code is structured to be integrated into the tmux command queue system, ensuring that locking operations are executed in the correct sequence and context.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_lock_server_entry
- **Type**: `const struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_lock_server_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command entry for the 'lock-server' command in the application. It specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, flags, and the function to execute when the command is invoked. This structure is part of a command handling system, likely in a terminal multiplexer application like tmux.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and register the 'lock-server' command, allowing it to be executed with the specified behavior in the application.


---
### cmd_lock_session_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_lock_session_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for locking a session in the tmux application. It specifies the command name as 'lock-session' with an alias 'locks', and includes argument specifications, usage information, target specifications, and execution flags. The execution function associated with this command is `cmd_lock_server_exec`, which handles the locking operation for a session.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and register the 'lock-session' command within the tmux application, allowing users to lock a specific session.


---
### cmd_lock_client_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_lock_client_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'lock-client' with an alias 'lockc'. It specifies the arguments, usage, flags, and execution function associated with this command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and register the 'lock-client' command within the application, allowing it to be executed with specific arguments and behavior.


# Functions

---
### cmd_lock_server_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_lock_server_exec}} -->
The `cmd_lock_server_exec` function executes a lock command on the server, session, or client based on the command entry associated with the `cmd` object.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command to be executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item, which provides context for the command execution.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the target session and target client from the `cmdq_item` using [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target) and [`cmdq_get_target_client`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target_client) respectively.
    - Check if the command entry of `self` is `cmd_lock_server_entry`; if true, call `server_lock()` to lock the server.
    - If the command entry of `self` is `cmd_lock_session_entry`, call `server_lock_session(target->s)` to lock the specified session.
    - Otherwise, call `server_lock_client(tc)` to lock the specified client.
    - Call `recalculate_sizes()` to adjust any necessary sizes after locking.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate normal command execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating successful execution of the lock command.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target)
    - [`cmdq_get_target_client`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target_client)
    - [`cmd_get_entry`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_entry)
    - [`server_lock`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_lock)
    - [`server_lock_session`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_lock_session)
    - [`server_lock_client`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_lock_client)
    - [`recalculate_sizes`](resize.c.driver.md#recalculate_sizes)
