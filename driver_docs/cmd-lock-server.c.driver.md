# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and is responsible for implementing lock commands within the application. The file defines three specific commands: `lock-server`, `lock-session`, and `lock-client`, each of which is associated with a command entry structure that specifies its name, alias, arguments, usage, and execution function. The primary function of these commands is to lock different components of the tmux environment: the entire server, a specific session, or a particular client. This functionality is crucial for maintaining security and preventing unauthorized access to active tmux sessions or clients.

The technical components of the file include the definition of command entry structures and a shared execution function, [`cmd_lock_server_exec`](#cmd_lock_server_exec), which determines the appropriate locking action based on the command being executed. The execution function utilizes helper functions such as `server_lock`, `server_lock_session`, and `server_lock_client` to perform the actual locking operations. The file is designed to be integrated into the broader tmux codebase, as indicated by its inclusion of the "tmux.h" header file, and it does not define a standalone executable. Instead, it provides specific command implementations that are part of the tmux command interface, contributing to the overall functionality of the tmux application.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_lock_server_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_lock_server_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command entry for the 'lock-server' command in the application. It includes the command's name, alias, argument specifications, usage information, flags, and the function to execute when the command is invoked.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'lock-server' command within the application, allowing it to be executed with the specified parameters and functionality.


---
### cmd_lock_session_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_lock_session_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'lock-session' with an alias 'locks'. It specifies the arguments, usage, target, flags, and execution function associated with the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and handle the 'lock-session' command within the application, specifying its behavior and execution.


---
### cmd_lock_client_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_lock_client_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'lock-client' with an alias 'lockc'. It specifies the arguments, usage, flags, and execution function associated with the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and register the 'lock-client' command within the application, allowing it to be executed with specific arguments and behavior.


# Functions

---
### cmd_lock_server_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_lock_server_exec}} -->
The `cmd_lock_server_exec` function executes a lock command on the server, session, or client based on the command entry type.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the target session or client from the `cmdq_item` using `cmdq_get_target` and `cmdq_get_target_client`.
    - Check if the command entry of `self` is `cmd_lock_server_entry`; if true, call `server_lock()` to lock the server.
    - If the command entry is `cmd_lock_session_entry`, call `server_lock_session(target->s)` to lock the specified session.
    - Otherwise, call `server_lock_client(tc)` to lock the specified client.
    - Call `recalculate_sizes()` to adjust any necessary sizes after locking.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate normal command execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating successful execution of the lock command.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_lock_server_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_lock_server_exec}} -->
Executes a lock command on the server, session, or client.
- **Description**: This function is used to execute a lock command based on the command entry associated with the provided command object. It can lock the entire server, a specific session, or a specific client, depending on the command entry. This function should be called when a lock operation is needed, and it assumes that the command and command queue item are properly initialized and valid. The function will recalculate sizes after performing the lock operation, ensuring that any changes in the state are accounted for.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a struct cmd representing the command to be executed. It must not be null and should be properly initialized with a valid command entry.
    - `item`: A pointer to a struct cmdq_item representing the command queue item. It must not be null and should be properly initialized to provide context for the command execution.
- **Output**: Returns CMD_RETURN_NORMAL to indicate successful execution of the lock command.
- **See also**: [`cmd_lock_server_exec`](#cmd_lock_server_exec)  (Implementation)
