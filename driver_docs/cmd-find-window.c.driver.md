# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer project and defines the functionality for the "find-window" command. The primary purpose of this file is to implement a command that searches for a window containing a specified text string within the `tmux` environment. The command is defined with various options, allowing users to customize their search criteria, such as case sensitivity and the scope of the search (e.g., window name, pane title, or content). The command is registered with a command entry structure, `cmd_find_window_entry`, which includes the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, and execution function.

The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`cmd_find_window_exec`](#cmd_find_window_exec) function, which processes the command's arguments and constructs a search filter based on the specified options. The function utilizes a combination of string formatting and logical expressions to create a filter that matches the desired search criteria. The filter is then applied to the target window pane, setting it into a specific mode that displays the search results. This file is a focused implementation of a single command within the broader `tmux` application, providing a specific utility for users to locate windows based on textual content.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_find_window_entry
- **Type**: ``const struct cmd_entry``
- **Description**: The `cmd_find_window_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'find-window' and its alias 'findw'. It specifies the arguments, usage, target, flags, and execution function for the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'find-window' command within the application.


# Functions

---
### cmd_find_window_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_find_window_exec}} -->
The `cmd_find_window_exec` function executes a command to find a window pane containing a specified text string, applying various filters based on command-line arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve command arguments using [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args) and target window pane using [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target).
    - Extract the search string from the arguments and initialize suffix and star variables for pattern matching.
    - Check for the presence of flags 'C', 'N', 'T', 'r', and 'i' to determine the search criteria and modify the suffix and star variables accordingly.
    - If none of 'C', 'N', or 'T' flags are set, default them to 1 to enable all search criteria.
    - Allocate memory for a filter of type `ARGS_STRING` using [`xcalloc`](xmalloc.c.driver.md#xcalloc).
    - Construct the filter string using [`xasprintf`](xmalloc.c.driver.md#xasprintf) based on the combination of 'C', 'N', and 'T' flags, incorporating the suffix and star variables for pattern matching.
    - Create a new argument list with [`args_create`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_create) and set the 'Z' flag if present, then set the filter argument.
    - Set the mode of the window pane to `window_tree_mode` using [`window_pane_set_mode`](window.c.driver.md#window_pane_set_mode) with the constructed arguments.
    - Free the newly created arguments using [`args_free`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_free).
- **Output**:
    - The function returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating successful execution of the command.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args)
    - [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target)
    - [`args_string`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_string)
    - [`args_has`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_has)
    - [`xcalloc`](xmalloc.c.driver.md#xcalloc)
    - [`xasprintf`](xmalloc.c.driver.md#xasprintf)
    - [`args_create`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_create)
    - [`args_set`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_set)
    - [`window_pane_set_mode`](window.c.driver.md#window_pane_set_mode)
    - [`args_free`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_free)
