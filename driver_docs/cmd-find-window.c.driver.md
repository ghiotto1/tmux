# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer project and implements the functionality for the "find-window" command. The primary purpose of this code is to locate a window within a `tmux` session that contains a specified text string. The command is defined with various options, such as case sensitivity and regular expression matching, allowing users to customize their search criteria. The code defines a command entry structure, `cmd_find_window_entry`, which includes the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, target, flags, and the execution function [`cmd_find_window_exec`](#cmd_find_window_exec).

The [`cmd_find_window_exec`](#cmd_find_window_exec) function is the core component of this file, responsible for executing the "find-window" command. It processes the command-line arguments to determine the search criteria and constructs a filter string that is used to match against window names, pane titles, or content. The function supports options for case-insensitive searches, regular expression matching, and targeting specific panes. Once the filter is constructed, it sets the mode of the target window pane to `window_tree_mode`, which likely displays the search results in a tree-like structure. This file is a focused implementation of a specific command within the broader `tmux` application, providing a public API for users to interact with and search through their terminal windows efficiently.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_find_window_entry
- **Type**: `const struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_find_window_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'find-window' and its alias 'findw'. It specifies the arguments, usage, target, flags, and execution function for the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'find-window' command within the application, allowing users to search for windows containing specific text.


# Functions

---
### cmd_find_window_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_find_window_exec}} -->
The `cmd_find_window_exec` function executes a command to find a window pane containing a specified text string, applying various filters based on command-line arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve command arguments using `cmd_get_args` and target window pane using `cmdq_get_target`.
    - Extract the search string from the arguments and initialize suffix and star variables for pattern matching.
    - Check for the presence of flags 'C', 'N', 'T', 'r', and 'i' to determine the search criteria and modify the suffix and star variables accordingly.
    - If none of 'C', 'N', or 'T' flags are set, default them to 1 to enable all search criteria.
    - Allocate memory for a filter of type `ARGS_STRING` and construct a search pattern string based on the combination of flags 'C', 'N', and 'T'.
    - Create a new set of arguments and set the 'Z' flag if present, then set the constructed filter as an argument.
    - Invoke `window_pane_set_mode` to apply the search mode to the target window pane with the constructed arguments.
    - Free the allocated memory for the new arguments.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating successful execution of the command.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_find_window_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_find_window_exec}} -->
Finds a window containing specified text.
- **Description**: This function is used to search for a window pane that contains a specific text string within a tmux session. It should be called when you need to locate a window pane by matching text against its content, name, or title. The function supports various flags to customize the search behavior, such as case sensitivity and regular expression matching. It must be called with a valid command and command queue item, and it modifies the mode of the target window pane to display the search results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a struct cmd representing the command to be executed. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to a struct cmdq_item representing the command queue item. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns an enum cmd_retval indicating the result of the command execution, typically CMD_RETURN_NORMAL on success.
- **See also**: [`cmd_find_window_exec`](#cmd_find_window_exec)  (Implementation)
