# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and implements the functionality for the "paste-buffer" command. The primary purpose of this code is to handle the pasting of text from a paste buffer into a specified target pane within a tmux session. The code defines a command entry structure, `cmd_paste_buffer_entry`, which includes the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, target specifications, and execution function. The execution function, [`cmd_paste_buffer_exec`](#cmd_paste_buffer_exec), is responsible for retrieving the specified paste buffer, handling optional arguments such as separators and bracketed paste mode, and writing the buffer's content to the target pane.

The code provides a narrow functionality focused on pasting operations within tmux, and it is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component of the larger tmux application. It defines a public API for the paste-buffer command, allowing users to interact with paste buffers through command-line options. The code handles various scenarios, such as checking if the target pane has exited, managing different separator options, and supporting bracketed paste mode. Additionally, it includes error handling for cases where the specified buffer does not exist or the target pane is not available for input.

- `stdlib.h`
- `string.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_paste_buffer_entry
- **Type**: ``const struct cmd_entry``
- **Description**: The `cmd_paste_buffer_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for pasting a buffer in the tmux application. It includes the command name, alias, argument specifications, usage instructions, target specifications, flags, and the function to execute the command. This structure is used to register and handle the 'paste-buffer' command within the tmux command framework.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and register the 'paste-buffer' command in tmux, allowing users to paste content from a buffer into a target pane.


# Functions

---
### cmd_paste_buffer_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_paste_buffer_exec}} -->
The `cmd_paste_buffer_exec` function pastes the contents of a specified or top paste buffer into a target window pane, optionally using a separator and handling bracketed paste mode.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item, which contains context such as the target pane.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments and target pane from the provided structures.
    - Check if the target pane has exited; if so, return an error.
    - Determine the buffer name from the arguments, defaulting to the top buffer if none is specified.
    - Retrieve the specified or top paste buffer; if it doesn't exist, return an error.
    - If the buffer exists and the pane is not in input-off mode, determine the separator string from the arguments, defaulting to carriage return or newline.
    - If bracketed paste mode is enabled, send the start bracket sequence to the pane.
    - Iterate over the buffer data, writing each line followed by the separator to the pane.
    - If bracketed paste mode is enabled, send the end bracket sequence to the pane.
    - If the delete flag is set in the arguments, free the paste buffer.
    - Return a normal command return value.
- **Output**:
    - Returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` on successful execution, or `CMD_RETURN_ERROR` if an error occurs, such as when the target pane has exited or the specified buffer does not exist.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_paste_buffer_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_paste_buffer_exec}} -->
Paste the contents of a paste buffer into a target pane.
- **Description**: This function pastes the contents of a specified or default paste buffer into a target pane within a tmux session. It should be called when you want to insert text from a buffer into a pane, optionally using a specified separator between lines. The function handles cases where the target pane has exited by returning an error. It also supports bracketed paste mode if the target pane's screen mode allows it. If the '-d' flag is provided, the buffer is deleted after pasting. Ensure the target pane is active and not in input-off mode before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the command structure. Must not be null. Used to retrieve command arguments.
    - `item`: A pointer to the command queue item. Must not be null. Used to determine the target pane for pasting.
- **Output**: Returns CMD_RETURN_ERROR if the target pane has exited or if the specified buffer does not exist. Otherwise, returns CMD_RETURN_NORMAL after pasting the buffer contents.
- **See also**: [`cmd_paste_buffer_exec`](#cmd_paste_buffer_exec)  (Implementation)
