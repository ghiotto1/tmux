# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux project, a terminal multiplexer, and it defines functionality for managing prompt history within the application. The file provides two main commands: "show-prompt-history" and "clear-prompt-history," which are used to display and clear the history of prompts, respectively. These commands are encapsulated in `cmd_entry` structures, which define their names, aliases, arguments, usage, and execution functions. The execution logic for both commands is handled by the [`cmd_show_prompt_history_exec`](#cmd_show_prompt_history_exec) function, which checks the command type and either displays the history of prompts or clears it based on the provided prompt type.

The code is structured to handle different types of prompts, as indicated by the use of a prompt type argument (`-T`). It interacts with global data structures that store the history of prompts (`status_prompt_hlist` and `status_prompt_hsize`) and uses helper functions to manage these structures. The file is designed to be part of a larger codebase, likely included in the tmux application, and it does not define a standalone executable. Instead, it provides specific functionality related to prompt history management, which can be accessed through the tmux command interface. The code is well-organized, with clear separation between command definitions and their execution logic, and it adheres to the conventions of the tmux codebase.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `tmux.h`
- `stdlib.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_show_prompt_history_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_show_prompt_history_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines a command for showing the prompt history in the application. It includes fields such as the command name, alias, arguments, usage, flags, and the execution function. This structure is used to register and handle the 'show-prompt-history' command within the application.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'show-prompt-history' command, allowing users to view the history of prompts.


---
### cmd_clear_prompt_history_entry
- **Type**: `const struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_clear_prompt_history_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines a command for clearing the prompt history in the application. It specifies the command name as "clear-prompt-history" and provides an alias "clearphist". The structure also includes argument specifications, usage instructions, and a flag indicating that the command should be executed after hooks.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and register the command for clearing prompt history, allowing users to execute it within the application.


# Functions

---
### cmd_show_prompt_history_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_show_prompt_history_exec}} -->
The `cmd_show_prompt_history_exec` function displays or clears the prompt history based on the command entry and optional prompt type argument.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the arguments from the command using [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args) and get the prompt type string using [`args_get`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_get).
    - Check if the command entry is `cmd_clear_prompt_history_entry`; if true, proceed to clear the prompt history.
    - If `typestr` is NULL, iterate over all prompt types and clear their histories by freeing memory and setting sizes to zero.
    - If `typestr` is not NULL, determine the prompt type using [`status_prompt_type`](status.c.driver.md#status_prompt_type); if invalid, return an error.
    - If the command entry is not `cmd_clear_prompt_history_entry`, display the prompt history.
    - If `typestr` is NULL, iterate over all prompt types and print their histories.
    - If `typestr` is not NULL, determine the prompt type and print its history.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` after processing.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` indicating the success or error status of the command execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args)
    - [`args_get`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_get)
    - [`cmd_get_entry`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_entry)
    - [`status_prompt_type`](status.c.driver.md#status_prompt_type)
    - [`status_prompt_type_string`](status.c.driver.md#status_prompt_type_string)
