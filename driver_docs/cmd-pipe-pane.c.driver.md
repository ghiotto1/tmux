# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer project and implements the functionality for the `pipe-pane` command. The primary purpose of this code is to manage the redirection of output from a specific pane within a `tmux` session to a specified shell command or file. The code defines the command's behavior, including its arguments and usage, and handles the execution of the command by setting up a pipe between the pane and the shell command. It includes mechanisms to handle input and output redirection, as well as error handling and cleanup processes.

The file contains several key components, including the [`cmd_pipe_pane_exec`](#cmd_pipe_pane_exec) function, which is responsible for executing the `pipe-pane` command. This function manages the lifecycle of the pipe, including opening and closing it, and forking a child process to execute the shell command. The code also defines callback functions for reading from, writing to, and handling errors on the pipe, ensuring that data is correctly transferred between the pane and the shell command. The use of `bufferevent` structures from the `libevent` library facilitates asynchronous I/O operations, allowing the `tmux` server to remain responsive while managing the pipe. Overall, this file provides a focused and specific functionality within the broader `tmux` application, enhancing its capability to interact with external processes.

# Functions

---
### cmd_pipe_pane_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_pipe_pane_exec}} -->
The `cmd_pipe_pane_exec` function manages the creation and execution of a pipe to redirect the output of a tmux pane to a specified shell command, handling both the setup and teardown of the pipe.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the target pane has exited; if so, return an error.
    - Destroy any existing pipe associated with the pane, freeing resources and closing file descriptors.
    - If no command is provided or the '-o' option is used with an existing pipe, return normally without creating a new pipe.
    - Determine the direction of data flow based on the presence of '-I' and '-O' options.
    - Create a socket pair for inter-process communication; if it fails, return an error.
    - Expand the shell command using the format tree and prepare it for execution.
    - Block signals and fork a child process to execute the shell command.
    - In the child process, redirect standard input/output/error as needed and execute the command using `execl`.
    - In the parent process, set up a non-blocking event for the pipe and enable read/write events based on the direction of data flow.
    - Return normally after setting up the pipe and event.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` indicating the success or failure of the operation, specifically `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` for success and `CMD_RETURN_ERROR` for failure.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_pipe_pane_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_pipe_pane_exec}} -->
Opens a pipe to redirect output from a tmux pane to a shell command.
- **Description**: This function is used to redirect the output of a specified tmux pane to a shell command, allowing for the capture or manipulation of pane output. It should be called when there is a need to process pane output externally. The function first checks if the target pane is active and not exited. If a pipe is already open, it will be closed before opening a new one, unless the '-o' option is specified, which prevents reopening if a pipe already exists. The function supports input and output redirection based on the provided options. It is important to ensure that the target pane is valid and that the command string is properly formatted. Errors during execution, such as socket creation or process forking failures, are reported, and the function returns an appropriate status code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the cmd structure representing the command being executed. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to the cmdq_item structure representing the command queue item. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns an enum cmd_retval indicating the success or failure of the operation. CMD_RETURN_ERROR is returned if the pane has exited or if there are errors in setting up the pipe. CMD_RETURN_NORMAL is returned on successful execution.
- **See also**: [`cmd_pipe_pane_exec`](#cmd_pipe_pane_exec)  (Implementation)

### cmd_pipe_pane_read_callback<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_pipe_pane_read_callback}} -->
Handles data read from a pipe associated with a window pane.
- **Description**: This function is a callback that processes data read from a pipe connected to a window pane. It is typically invoked when there is data available to read from the pipe. The function writes the available data to the pane's event buffer and then drains the input buffer. If the window pane is marked for destruction, it triggers the destruction process. This function should be used in contexts where a window pane's output is being piped and needs to be managed asynchronously.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bufev`: This parameter is unused in the function and can be ignored.
    - `data`: A pointer to a window_pane structure. It must not be null and should point to a valid window pane object that is associated with the pipe event.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`cmd_pipe_pane_read_callback`](#cmd_pipe_pane_read_callback)  (Implementation)


---
### cmd_pipe_pane_write_callback<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_pipe_pane_write_callback}} -->
Handles the write event for a pipe associated with a window pane.
- **Description**: This function is a callback that is triggered when the write buffer of a pipe associated with a window pane becomes empty. It logs the event and checks if the window pane is ready to be destroyed. If the pane is ready, it initiates the destruction process. This function is typically used in the context of managing the lifecycle of a window pane that is connected to a pipe, ensuring that resources are cleaned up when no longer needed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bufev`: This parameter is unused in the function and can be ignored.
    - `data`: A pointer to a `struct window_pane` that represents the window pane associated with the pipe. Must not be null, as it is used to determine if the pane is ready to be destroyed.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`cmd_pipe_pane_write_callback`](#cmd_pipe_pane_write_callback)  (Implementation)

### cmd_pipe_pane_error_callback<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_pipe_pane_error_callback}} -->
Handles errors for a pipe associated with a window pane.
- **Description**: This function is used as a callback to handle errors that occur on a pipe associated with a window pane. It is typically invoked when an error event is detected on the pipe's bufferevent. The function logs the error, frees the associated bufferevent, closes the pipe file descriptor, and sets it to -1 to indicate it is no longer valid. If the window pane is ready to be destroyed, it triggers the destruction process. This function should be used in contexts where robust error handling for pane pipes is necessary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bufev`: A pointer to the bufferevent associated with the pipe. This parameter is unused in the function.
    - `what`: A short integer indicating the type of error event. This parameter is unused in the function.
    - `data`: A pointer to the window_pane structure associated with the pipe. Must not be null, as it is used to access and modify the pane's state.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`cmd_pipe_pane_error_callback`](#cmd_pipe_pane_error_callback)  (Implementation)
