# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and implements the functionality for the "pipe-pane" command. The primary purpose of this code is to manage the redirection of output from a tmux pane to a specified shell command or file. The code defines the command's behavior, including its arguments and usage, and handles the execution of the command by setting up a pipe between the tmux pane and the specified shell command. The command can be used to either read from or write to the pane, or both, depending on the flags provided.

The file includes several key components: the [`cmd_pipe_pane_exec`](#cmd_pipe_pane_exec) function, which is responsible for executing the command, and several callback functions ([`cmd_pipe_pane_read_callback`](#cmd_pipe_pane_read_callback), [`cmd_pipe_pane_write_callback`](#cmd_pipe_pane_write_callback), and [`cmd_pipe_pane_error_callback`](#cmd_pipe_pane_error_callback)) that handle the reading, writing, and error events of the pipe, respectively. The code uses socket pairs to create a communication channel between the tmux pane and the shell command, and it employs the `bufferevent` structure from the libevent library to manage asynchronous I/O operations. This file is a part of the broader tmux codebase and is intended to be compiled and linked with other components of tmux, rather than being a standalone executable.

# Global Variables

### cmd_pipe_pane_entry
- **Type**: `const struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_pipe_pane_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'pipe-pane' and its associated properties. It includes the command name, alias, argument specifications, usage instructions, target specifications, flags, and the execution function pointer. This structure is used to register and handle the 'pipe-pane' command within the application.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and manage the 'pipe-pane' command, allowing users to open a pipe to redirect pane output in the application.


# Functions

---
### cmd_pipe_pane_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_pipe_pane_exec}} -->
The `cmd_pipe_pane_exec` function manages the creation and execution of a pipe to redirect the output of a tmux pane to a specified shell command, handling both input and output redirection based on provided arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the target pane has exited; if so, return an error.
    - Destroy any existing pipe associated with the pane, freeing resources and closing file descriptors.
    - If no command is provided in the arguments, return normally without creating a new pipe.
    - If the '-o' option is specified and a pipe already exists, return normally without creating a new pipe.
    - Determine the direction of data flow based on the presence of '-I' and '-O' options in the arguments.
    - Create a new socket pair for the pipe; if this fails, return an error.
    - Expand the shell command using the format tree and the provided arguments.
    - Fork the process to execute the shell command in a child process.
    - In the child process, set up file descriptors for input/output redirection and execute the shell command using `execl`.
    - In the parent process, set up the pipe file descriptor and event handling for the pane, enabling read/write events as necessary.
    - Return normally after setting up the pipe and event handling.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` indicating the success or failure of the operation, specifically `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` for success and `CMD_RETURN_ERROR` for failure.

### cmd_pipe_pane_read_callback<!-- {{#callable:cmd_pipe_pane_read_callback}} -->
The `cmd_pipe_pane_read_callback` function handles reading data from a buffer event associated with a window pane, writing it to another event, and checking if the pane should be destroyed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bufev`: A pointer to the bufferevent structure, which is unused in this function.
    - `data`: A pointer to the window_pane structure, representing the pane associated with the pipe event.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the input buffer from the window pane's pipe event.
    - Calculate the amount of data available in the buffer.
    - Log the amount of data read from the pipe for debugging purposes.
    - Write the available data from the buffer to the window pane's event.
    - Drain the buffer to remove the data that has been written.
    - Check if the window pane is ready to be destroyed and, if so, call the function to destroy it.
- **Output**:
    - This function does not return a value; it performs operations on the window pane and its associated events.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`window_pane_destroy_ready`](window.c.driver.md#window_pane_destroy_ready)
    - [`server_destroy_pane`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_destroy_pane)


---
### cmd_pipe_pane_write_callback<!-- {{#callable:cmd_pipe_pane_write_callback}} -->
The `cmd_pipe_pane_write_callback` function checks if a window pane is ready to be destroyed after its associated pipe is empty and initiates its destruction if so.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bufev`: A pointer to a `bufferevent` structure, which is unused in this function.
    - `data`: A pointer to a `window_pane` structure, representing the pane associated with the pipe event.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Log a debug message indicating that the pipe for the window pane is empty, using the pane's ID.
    - Check if the window pane is ready to be destroyed by calling `window_pane_destroy_ready(wp)`.
    - If the pane is ready to be destroyed, call `server_destroy_pane(wp, 1)` to destroy the pane.
- **Output**:
    - This function does not return any value; it performs actions based on the state of the window pane.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`window_pane_destroy_ready`](window.c.driver.md#window_pane_destroy_ready)
    - [`server_destroy_pane`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_destroy_pane)

### cmd_pipe_pane_error_callback<!-- {{#callable:cmd_pipe_pane_error_callback}} -->
The `cmd_pipe_pane_error_callback` function handles errors in the pipe event for a window pane by logging the error, freeing resources, and potentially destroying the pane if it is ready.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bufev`: A pointer to the bufferevent structure associated with the pipe event, marked as unused.
    - `what`: A short integer indicating the type of event that occurred, marked as unused.
    - `data`: A pointer to the window_pane structure, representing the pane associated with the pipe event.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Log a debug message indicating a pipe error for the window pane identified by its ID.
    - Free the bufferevent associated with the window pane's pipe event.
    - Close the file descriptor for the pipe and set it to -1 to indicate it is no longer valid.
    - Check if the window pane is ready to be destroyed using [`window_pane_destroy_ready`](window.c.driver.md#window_pane_destroy_ready).
    - If the pane is ready to be destroyed, call [`server_destroy_pane`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_destroy_pane) to destroy it.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return any value; it performs cleanup and potentially destroys the window pane.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`window_pane_destroy_ready`](window.c.driver.md#window_pane_destroy_ready)
    - [`server_destroy_pane`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_destroy_pane)
