# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer and implements a clock mode feature. The primary functionality of this code is to display a digital clock within a tmux window pane. It defines a mode called "clock-mode" that initializes, manages, and renders a clock display using ASCII art. The clock is updated every minute, and the display is refreshed accordingly. The code includes functions for initializing the clock mode, handling key events, resizing the display, and freeing resources when the mode is exited. The clock is drawn using a predefined character matrix for digits and letters, allowing it to display time in either 12-hour or 24-hour format.

The file is structured around the `window_mode` structure, which defines the interface for the clock mode, including initialization, resizing, key handling, and cleanup functions. The `window_clock_mode_data` structure holds the state of the clock, including the current time and a timer event for periodic updates. The code uses the `libevent` library to manage the timer, ensuring the clock updates every second. The drawing logic is encapsulated in the [`window_clock_draw_screen`](#window_clock_draw_screen) function, which uses the `screen_write` API to render the clock on the screen. This file is intended to be part of the tmux source code and is not a standalone executable; it provides a specific feature that can be integrated into the broader tmux application.

# Data Structures

---
### window_clock_mode_data
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `screen`: Represents the screen associated with the clock mode.
    - `tim`: Stores the current time as a time_t value.
    - `timer`: Holds an event structure for managing timer events.
- **Description**: The `window_clock_mode_data` structure is used to manage the state and behavior of a clock mode in a window.
