# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer and implements a clock mode feature. The primary functionality of this code is to display a digital clock within a tmux window pane. The code defines a `window_mode` structure named `window_clock_mode`, which includes function pointers for initializing, freeing, resizing, and handling key events for the clock mode. The clock is rendered using a predefined character matrix (`window_clock_table`) that represents digits and characters in a 5x5 grid format, allowing the time to be displayed in a stylized manner.

The file includes several static functions that manage the lifecycle and behavior of the clock mode. The [`window_clock_init`](#window_clock_init) function sets up the clock mode, initializing a screen and setting a timer to update the display every minute. The [`window_clock_timer_callback`](#window_clock_timer_callback) function is responsible for updating the clock display when the timer expires. The [`window_clock_draw_screen`](#window_clock_draw_screen) function handles the actual rendering of the time on the screen, adjusting the display based on the current time and the configured style (12-hour or 24-hour format). This code is designed to be integrated into the tmux application, providing a specialized mode for users to view the current time within their terminal sessions.

# Global Variables

---
### window_clock_init
- **Type**: `static struct screen *`
- **Description**: The `window_clock_init` function is a static function that initializes a screen for the clock mode in a window. It sets up the necessary data structures and timers to display a clock on the screen.
- **Use**: This function is used to initialize the clock mode by setting up the screen and starting a timer for periodic updates.


---
### window_clock_mode
- **Type**: `const struct window_mode`
- **Description**: The `window_clock_mode` is a constant structure of type `window_mode` that defines the behavior and properties of a clock mode in a windowing system. It includes function pointers for initialization, freeing resources, resizing, and handling key events specific to the clock mode.
- **Use**: This variable is used to manage and define the operations related to the clock mode within the windowing system, such as initializing the mode, handling key inputs, and resizing.


---
### window_clock_table
- **Type**: `const char[14][5][5]`
- **Description**: The `window_clock_table` is a constant 3D array of characters that represents a set of 5x5 pixel patterns for displaying digits (0-9), a colon (:), and the letters A, P, and M. Each sub-array corresponds to a character, with '1' indicating a filled pixel and '0' indicating an empty pixel.
- **Use**: This variable is used to render a digital clock display in a terminal, showing time in a graphical format using the defined pixel patterns.


# Data Structures

---
### window_clock_mode_data
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `screen`: A structure representing the screen where the clock is displayed.
    - `tim`: A time_t variable storing the current time.
    - `timer`: An event structure used to manage the clock's timer events.
- **Description**: The `window_clock_mode_data` structure is used in the context of a clock mode within a window, likely in a terminal multiplexer like tmux. It contains a `screen` structure to manage the display of the clock, a `time_t` variable `tim` to keep track of the current time, and an `event` structure `timer` to handle periodic updates to the clock display.


# Functions

---
### window_clock_timer_callback<!-- {{#callable:window_clock_timer_callback}} -->
The `window_clock_timer_callback` function updates the clock display in a window pane at regular intervals, ensuring the time is redrawn if the minute has changed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fd`: An unused integer representing a file descriptor, typically used in event callbacks.
    - `events`: An unused short integer representing event types, typically used in event callbacks.
    - `arg`: A pointer to a `window_mode_entry` structure, which contains data about the window mode and is used to access the window pane and clock mode data.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the `arg` parameter to a `window_mode_entry` pointer, extracting the associated `window_pane` and `window_clock_mode_data`.
    - It deletes the current event timer and sets a new one to trigger after one second.
    - The function checks if the current mode entry is the first in the window pane's mode list; if not, it returns early.
    - It retrieves the current time and compares the current minute with the stored minute in `data->tim`.
    - If the minutes are the same, the function returns without further action.
    - If the minutes differ, it updates `data->tim` with the current time and calls [`window_clock_draw_screen`](#window_clock_draw_screen) to redraw the clock.
    - Finally, it sets the `PANE_REDRAW` flag on the window pane to indicate that the pane needs to be redrawn.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it operates by side effects, updating the timer and potentially redrawing the window pane.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`window_clock_draw_screen`](#window_clock_draw_screen)
