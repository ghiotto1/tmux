# Purpose
This C header file, `compat.h`, serves as a compatibility layer to ensure that a program can be compiled and run across different systems and environments, particularly those with varying levels of support for certain functions and libraries. It includes conditional inclusion of system headers and defines macros and functions that may be missing on some platforms, such as `strlcpy`, `strlcat`, `clock_gettime`, and others. The file also provides alternative implementations for functions and macros that are not available in older or non-standard environments, ensuring that the program can maintain functionality regardless of the underlying system's capabilities. Additionally, it includes compatibility definitions for various system paths and constants, making it a comprehensive solution for cross-platform compatibility in C programs.

# Global Variables

---
### strcasestr
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `strcasestr` variable is a function pointer that points to a function which searches for the first occurrence of a substring in a string, ignoring the case of both strings. It is defined as a pointer to a function that takes two constant character pointers as arguments and returns a character pointer.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide a case-insensitive substring search functionality in environments where the `strcasestr` function is not natively available.


---
### strsep
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `strsep` variable is a function pointer to a function that takes two arguments: a pointer to a character pointer and a constant character pointer. It returns a character pointer. This function is typically used to split a string into tokens based on a set of delimiter characters.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide a compatible implementation of the `strsep` function when it is not available in the standard library.


---
### strndup
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `strndup` variable is a function pointer that points to a function which duplicates a specified number of characters from a given string. It takes two parameters: a constant character pointer to the source string and a size_t value indicating the number of characters to duplicate.
- **Use**: This function pointer is used to create a new string by duplicating a specified number of characters from an existing string, ensuring memory allocation for the new string.


---
### memmem
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `memmem` variable is a function pointer that represents a function used to locate a sequence of bytes within another sequence of bytes. It takes four parameters: two pointers to the memory areas to be searched and their respective sizes.
- **Use**: This function pointer is used to find a specific byte sequence within a larger memory block.


---
### getprogname
- **Type**: `const char*`
- **Description**: The `getprogname` variable is a function that returns a constant character pointer. It is used to retrieve the name of the program currently being executed.
- **Use**: This function is used to obtain the program's name, which can be useful for logging, error messages, or other identification purposes.


---
### fgetln
- **Type**: `char *`
- **Description**: The `fgetln` function is a global function that reads a line from a file stream and returns a pointer to the line, along with its length. It is typically used to read lines from a file until EOF is reached.
- **Use**: This function is used to read a line from a file stream, returning a pointer to the line and updating the length of the line read.


---
### reallocarray
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `reallocarray` is a function pointer that points to a function which reallocates memory for an array. It takes three parameters: a pointer to the existing memory block, and two `size_t` values representing the number of elements and the size of each element, respectively.
- **Use**: This function is used to dynamically resize an array in memory, ensuring that the total size does not overflow.


---
### recallocarray
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `recallocarray` is a function pointer that points to a function which reallocates memory for an array, changing its size and initializing any newly allocated memory to zero. It takes four parameters: a pointer to the existing memory block, the old number of elements, the new number of elements, and the size of each element.
- **Use**: This function is used to resize an array while ensuring that any newly allocated memory is zeroed out.


---
### BSDopterr
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: `BSDopterr` is a global integer variable used in the context of command-line option parsing. It is part of a custom implementation of the `getopt` function, which is used to parse command-line options in a manner similar to the standard library function.
- **Use**: `BSDopterr` is used to control whether error messages are printed by the `BSDgetopt` function when an unrecognized option is encountered.


---
### BSDoptind
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: `BSDoptind` is an external integer variable used in the context of command-line argument parsing. It is part of a custom implementation of the `getopt` function, which is used to parse command-line options in a manner similar to the standard `getopt` function.
- **Use**: `BSDoptind` is used to track the index of the next element to be processed in the command-line arguments array.


---
### BSDoptopt
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: `BSDoptopt` is an external integer variable used in the context of command-line option parsing. It is part of a set of variables that mimic the behavior of the standard getopt function, but with a BSD-specific implementation.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the last known option character that caused an error during option parsing.


---
### BSDoptreset
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: `BSDoptreset` is an external integer variable used in the context of command-line option parsing. It is part of a set of variables that mimic the behavior of the standard getopt function, but with a BSD-specific implementation.
- **Use**: This variable is used to reset the state of option parsing, allowing the parsing process to be restarted.


---
### BSDoptarg
- **Type**: `char*`
- **Description**: `BSDoptarg` is a global variable of type `char*` that is used to store the argument value of an option processed by the `BSDgetopt` function. It is part of a custom implementation of the `getopt` function, which is used for parsing command-line options.
- **Use**: `BSDoptarg` is used to hold the argument value associated with a command-line option when `BSDgetopt` is called.
