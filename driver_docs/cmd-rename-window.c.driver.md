# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and provides a specific functionality to rename a window within a tmux session. The code defines a command, "rename-window" (with an alias "renamew"), which allows users to change the name of a specified window. The command is implemented as part of the tmux command framework, which involves defining a command entry structure (`cmd_entry`) that specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, target, flags, and the function to execute the command. The execution function, [`cmd_rename_window_exec`](#cmd_rename_window_exec), retrieves the new name for the window from the command arguments, sets the window's name, disables automatic renaming, and updates the server to reflect the changes visually.

The file is structured to integrate seamlessly with the tmux command processing system, utilizing existing data structures and functions such as `cmd_get_args`, `cmdq_get_target`, and `format_single_from_target`. It does not define a public API or external interface but rather extends the internal command set of tmux. The code is focused on a narrow functionality, specifically the renaming of windows, and is designed to be part of a larger codebase where it interacts with other components to manage window properties and user interactions within tmux sessions.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_rename_window_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_rename_window_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for renaming a window in the tmux application. It includes the command name, alias, argument specifications, usage information, target specifications, flags, and the function to execute the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'rename-window' command within the tmux application, allowing users to rename windows.


# Functions

---
### cmd_rename_window_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_rename_window_exec}} -->
The function `cmd_rename_window_exec` renames a window in the tmux session to a specified new name and updates the window's status and borders.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item, which provides context for the command execution.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments using [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args) and store them in `args`.
    - Get the target window link (`wl`) from the command queue item using [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target).
    - Format the new window name using [`format_single_from_target`](format.c.driver.md#format_single_from_target) and the first argument from [`args_string`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_string).
    - Set the window's name to the newly formatted name using [`window_set_name`](window.c.driver.md#window_set_name).
    - Disable automatic renaming of the window by setting the 'automatic-rename' option to 0 using [`options_set_number`](options.c.driver.md#options_set_number).
    - Redraw the window borders using [`server_redraw_window_borders`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_redraw_window_borders).
    - Update the window's status using [`server_status_window`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_status_window).
    - Free the memory allocated for the new window name.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating that the command executed successfully.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args)
    - [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target)
    - [`format_single_from_target`](format.c.driver.md#format_single_from_target)
    - [`args_string`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_string)
    - [`window_set_name`](window.c.driver.md#window_set_name)
    - [`options_set_number`](options.c.driver.md#options_set_number)
    - [`server_redraw_window_borders`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_redraw_window_borders)
    - [`server_status_window`](server-fn.c.driver.md#server_status_window)
