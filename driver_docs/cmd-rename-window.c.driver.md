# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and provides a specific functionality to rename a window within a tmux session. The code defines a command, "rename-window" (with an alias "renamew"), which allows users to change the name of a specified window. The command is implemented as part of the tmux command framework, which involves defining a command entry structure (`cmd_entry`) that specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, target, flags, and the function to execute the command. The execution function, [`cmd_rename_window_exec`](#cmd_rename_window_exec), retrieves the new name for the window from the command arguments, sets the window's name, disables automatic renaming, and updates the server to reflect the changes visually.

The code is structured to integrate seamlessly with the tmux command processing system, utilizing existing tmux data structures and functions such as `cmd_get_args`, `cmdq_get_target`, and `format_single_from_target`. It is not a standalone executable but rather a component of the larger tmux application, intended to be compiled and linked with the rest of the tmux codebase. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces; instead, it extends the internal command set of tmux, providing a specific utility for users to manage window names within their tmux sessions.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_rename_window_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_rename_window_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for renaming a window in the tmux application. It includes the command name, alias, argument specifications, usage information, target specifications, flags, and a pointer to the execution function. This structure is used to register and handle the 'rename-window' command within the tmux command framework.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'rename-window' command in tmux, allowing users to rename a window by specifying a target window and a new name.


# Functions

---
### cmd_rename_window_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_rename_window_exec}} -->
The `cmd_rename_window_exec` function renames a specified window in the tmux session to a new name provided by the user.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item, which contains context for the command execution.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the arguments for the command using `cmd_get_args(self)`.
    - Get the target window link (`winlink`) from the command queue item using `cmdq_get_target(item)`.
    - Format the new window name from the target using `format_single_from_target(item, args_string(args, 0))`.
    - Set the new name for the window using `window_set_name(wl->window, newname)`.
    - Disable automatic renaming for the window by setting the 'automatic-rename' option to 0 using `options_set_number(wl->window->options, "automatic-rename", 0)`.
    - Redraw the window borders using `server_redraw_window_borders(wl->window)`.
    - Update the window status using `server_status_window(wl->window)`.
    - Free the memory allocated for `newname`.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating that the command executed successfully.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_rename_window_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_rename_window_exec}} -->
Rename a specified window to a new name.
- **Description**: This function is used to rename a window in the tmux session to a new specified name. It should be called when a window needs to be renamed, and it updates the window's name and disables automatic renaming for that window. The function also triggers a redraw of the window's borders and updates its status. It is important to ensure that the target window is correctly specified before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the cmd structure representing the command context. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to the cmdq_item structure representing the command queue item. Must not be null and should contain a valid target window.
- **Output**: Returns CMD_RETURN_NORMAL to indicate successful execution.
- **See also**: [`cmd_rename_window_exec`](#cmd_rename_window_exec)  (Implementation)
