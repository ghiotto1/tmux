# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and implements the functionality for splitting a window into multiple panes. The primary function defined in this file is [`cmd_split_window_exec`](#cmd_split_window_exec), which is responsible for executing the "split-window" command. This command allows users to divide a tmux window into separate panes either horizontally or vertically, depending on the specified options. The file defines the command's entry point, `cmd_split_window_entry`, which includes the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, and the function to execute when the command is invoked.

The code handles various command-line arguments to customize the behavior of the split operation, such as specifying the size of the new pane, the layout direction (horizontal or vertical), and whether the new pane should be detached or zoomed. It also manages the environment for the new pane, processes input commands, and updates the tmux session and window state accordingly. The file is a crucial component of the tmux command suite, providing a specific and essential feature that enhances the user's ability to manage terminal sessions efficiently.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Global Variables

---
### cmd_split_window_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_split_window_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command entry for the 'split-window' command in the tmux application. It includes details such as the command name, alias, arguments, usage, target, flags, and the execution function associated with the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'split-window' command, which is responsible for splitting a window into multiple panes in the tmux terminal multiplexer.


# Functions

---
### cmd_split_window_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_split_window_exec}} -->
The `cmd_split_window_exec` function splits a window into a new pane within a terminal multiplexer, handling various options and configurations for the new pane.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve command arguments and current/target states from the command queue item.
    - Determine the layout type for the split (top-bottom or left-right) based on the presence of the 'h' flag.
    - Calculate the size of the new pane based on the 'l' or 'p' flags, handling errors if size calculation fails.
    - Push the current window zoom state if the 'Z' flag is present.
    - Set flags for the new pane based on the presence of 'b', 'f', 'I', and other flags.
    - Attempt to split the pane using `layout_split_pane`; return an error if no space is available.
    - Initialize a `spawn_context` structure with the necessary parameters for spawning the new pane.
    - Populate the environment for the new pane with variables specified by the 'e' flag.
    - Spawn the new pane using `spawn_pane`; handle errors if pane creation fails.
    - If input is required, start input on the new pane and handle errors if input fails.
    - If the 'd' flag is not present, update the current pane state to the new pane.
    - Pop the zoom state and redraw the window and session status.
    - If the 'P' flag is present, format and print the new pane's information using a specified or default template.
    - Insert a hook for 'after-split-window' to execute after the pane is split.
    - Free allocated resources and return the appropriate command return value based on the input state.
- **Output**:
    - Returns an `enum cmd_retval` indicating the result of the command execution, which can be `CMD_RETURN_ERROR`, `CMD_RETURN_WAIT`, or `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_split_window_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_split_window_exec}} -->
Splits a window to create a new pane.
- **Description**: This function is used to split an existing window pane into two, creating a new pane within the same window. It can be configured to split horizontally or vertically, and allows for various options such as specifying the size of the new pane, starting a shell command in the new pane, and setting environment variables. The function must be called with a valid command and queue item, and it handles errors by returning appropriate command return values. It is typically used in environments where window management is required, such as terminal multiplexers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the command structure representing the split-window command. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to the command queue item that is currently being executed. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns an enum cmd_retval indicating the result of the command execution, such as CMD_RETURN_NORMAL, CMD_RETURN_ERROR, or CMD_RETURN_WAIT.
- **See also**: [`cmd_split_window_exec`](#cmd_split_window_exec)  (Implementation)
