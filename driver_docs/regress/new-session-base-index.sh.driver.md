# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate the testing of the tmux terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on the configuration of window indexing. It provides narrow functionality, primarily setting up a tmux session with specific base index values for windows and verifying that these settings are applied correctly. The script creates a temporary configuration file to set the base index for the first and second windows, starts a tmux session using this configuration, and checks if the window indices match the expected values. If the indices do not match, the script exits with an error code. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility script for testing and verifying specific tmux configurations.
