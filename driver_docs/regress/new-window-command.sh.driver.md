# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate the testing of a `tmux` session, providing narrow functionality specific to this task. It sets up a temporary `tmux` environment by defining a custom `TMUX` command with a test server name, and then creates a temporary file containing a series of `tmux` commands to open new windows and execute sleep commands. The script ensures that the `tmux` server is killed before and after the test to prevent interference with other sessions. It checks if the expected number of windows (four) is created, and if not, it exits with an error code. This script is likely part of a test suite for validating `tmux` behavior or configurations, rather than being a standalone executable or a library file.
