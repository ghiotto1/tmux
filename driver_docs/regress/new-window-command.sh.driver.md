# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate the testing of a `tmux` session, providing a narrow functionality specific to managing and verifying the creation of multiple `tmux` windows. It is an executable script that sets up a temporary `tmux` session using a configuration file created on-the-fly, which specifies the creation of several new windows running sleep commands. The script ensures that the `tmux` server is cleanly started and stopped, and it checks that the expected number of windows is created, exiting with an error code if the test fails. This script is likely used in a development or testing environment to verify the behavior of `tmux` or related configurations.
