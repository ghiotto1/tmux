# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate the testing of a `tmux` session, providing a narrow functionality specific to managing and verifying `tmux` sessions. It is an executable script that sets up a temporary configuration file to create three new `tmux` sessions, each running a `sleep` command with different durations. The script checks if exactly three sessions are created and exits with an error code if the condition is not met, ensuring the correct behavior of the `tmux` session management. Additionally, it includes cleanup operations to remove temporary files and terminate any `tmux` server instances started by the script, maintaining a clean environment after execution.
