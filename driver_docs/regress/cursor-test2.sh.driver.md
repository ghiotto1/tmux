# Purpose
This shell script is a test script designed to automate the testing of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on cursor positioning and window resizing functionality. It sets up a temporary `tmux` session with a specific configuration, executes a series of commands to manipulate the terminal window size, and captures the cursor position and screen content at various stages. The results are compared against an expected output file (`cursor-test2.result`) to verify correct behavior. The script provides narrow functionality, as it is tailored to test specific features of `tmux` rather than serving as a general-purpose tool or library.
