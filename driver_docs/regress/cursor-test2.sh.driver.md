# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate testing for the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, providing a narrow functionality focused on verifying cursor positioning and window resizing behavior. It sets up a `tmux` session with specific dimensions, executes a series of commands to manipulate the terminal window size, and captures the cursor position and screen content at various stages. The results are compared against an expected output file (`cursor-test2.result`) to determine if the test passes. The script is intended to be executed directly, as it includes setup, execution, and cleanup steps, such as creating temporary files and ensuring the `tmux` server is terminated after the test.
