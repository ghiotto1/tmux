# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate the testing of a `tmux` configuration, providing narrow functionality specific to this purpose. It sets up two `tmux` sessions with distinct server names (`-Ltest` and `-Ltest2`), configures various `tmux` settings such as terminal overrides and status line formats, and then captures the output to verify that the configuration behaves as expected. The script uses temporary files to store output and includes cleanup commands to ensure no residual `tmux` servers remain after execution. This script is not a standalone executable but rather a utility script intended for testing and validating `tmux` configurations in a controlled environment.
