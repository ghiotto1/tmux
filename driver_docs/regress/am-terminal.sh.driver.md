# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate the testing of a `tmux` configuration, providing narrow functionality specific to this purpose. It sets up two `tmux` sessions with different configurations and verifies that the status line displays as expected. The script first ensures any existing `tmux` servers are terminated, then creates temporary sessions with specific status line settings, captures the output, and compares it against an expected result. This script is not an executable for general use but rather a test script intended to validate the behavior of `tmux` configurations, likely as part of a larger suite of tests for a `tmux` setup or modification.
