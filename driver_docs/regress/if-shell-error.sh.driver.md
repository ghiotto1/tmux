# Purpose
This shell script is a test script designed to verify the behavior of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer when encountering an error in a configuration file. It provides narrow functionality, specifically testing the error handling of `tmux` when an invalid command is present. The script sets up the environment by defining the `PATH` and `TERM` variables, locates the `tmux` executable, and ensures any existing `tmux` server is terminated. It then creates temporary files to hold a test configuration and capture output, using a trap to clean up these files upon exit. The script writes a deliberately incorrect command to the configuration file and runs `tmux` with this configuration, checking the output for a specific error message to confirm that `tmux` correctly identifies and reports the error.
# Global Variables

---
### PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `PATH` variable is a global environment variable that specifies a list of directories where executable programs are located. It is used by the shell to locate commands that are entered without a full path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the directories that the shell searches for executable files, allowing users to run commands without specifying their full path.


---
### TERM
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TERM` variable is a global environment variable set to the value 'screen'. It is used to specify the terminal type that the shell or programs should emulate or interact with. In this script, it is set to 'screen', which is a common terminal type used for terminal multiplexers.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the terminal type for the shell environment, affecting how terminal-based applications interpret the terminal capabilities.


---
### TEST_TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `TEST_TMUX` is a global variable that stores the absolute path to the `tmux` executable. It is initialized by using the `readlink` command to resolve the path of `../tmux` relative to the current directory. If `TEST_TMUX` is not already set, it will be assigned this resolved path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct the `TMUX` command with a specific socket name for testing purposes.


---
### TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMUX` variable is a string that combines the path to the `tmux` executable with the `-Ltest` option, which specifies a unique server socket name for the `tmux` session. This allows for isolated testing of `tmux` commands without interfering with other `tmux` sessions that might be running on the system.
- **Use**: This variable is used to execute `tmux` commands with a specific server socket name for testing purposes.


---
### TMP
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMP` variable is a global variable that stores the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. This file is used to store a script that is later executed by the `tmux` command.
- **Use**: `TMP` is used to hold the path of a temporary file for storing a script that is executed and then checked for errors.


---
### OUT
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The variable `OUT` is a global variable that holds the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. This file is used to store the output of a command executed by the `tmux` session.
- **Use**: `OUT` is used to capture and store the output of a `tmux` command for later processing or verification.
