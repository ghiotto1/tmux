# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to automate testing of text navigation and selection features within the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. It provides narrow functionality, specifically focusing on verifying the behavior of various text navigation commands in `tmux`'s copy mode. The script sets up a `tmux` session, loads a test file, and executes a series of commands to test how `tmux` handles word and space navigation, including edge cases like line breaks, symbols, and digits. It checks the results of these operations against expected outcomes to ensure correct functionality. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a test script intended to be run in a development or testing environment to validate `tmux`'s text manipulation capabilities.
