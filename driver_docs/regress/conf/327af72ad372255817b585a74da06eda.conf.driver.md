# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux. This file customizes the behavior and appearance of tmux sessions. It sets various global and window-specific options, such as the default terminal type (`tmux-256color`), the command prefix key (`^X`), and the history limit for command output (`10000`). The configuration also specifies key bindings for navigating and managing windows, such as creating new windows or detaching clients. Additionally, it defines conditional styling for the status bar and window status based on the host domain, allowing for visual differentiation depending on the environment. The use of vi-style keys for navigation and specific color schemes for messages and status bars enhances usability and visual clarity.
