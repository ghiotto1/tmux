# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux. This file customizes the behavior and appearance of tmux sessions. It sets various global and window-specific options, such as the escape time for key sequences, the default terminal type, and the command prefix key, which is changed to Ctrl+X. The configuration also specifies a large history limit for command recall and enables vi-style key bindings for navigation. Additionally, it defines color schemes for status messages and window status based on the host domain, allowing for visual differentiation of environments. Key bindings are customized to streamline window management, such as switching to the last window, creating new windows, and detaching clients.
