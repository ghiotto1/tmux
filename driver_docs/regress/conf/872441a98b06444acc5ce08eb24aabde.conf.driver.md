# Purpose
The provided file contents are a configuration script for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux. This script customizes key bindings and mouse interactions within tmux sessions to enhance navigation and usability. It defines key bindings for directional navigation between panes using arrow keys, and mouse wheel actions for scrolling within panes. Additionally, it includes a command to open a session tree view with the 'w' key and a custom behavior for double-clicking on words, which opens the Emacs editor in a popup window, either navigating to a specific line in a file or opening a file directly. The configuration also includes a command to split panes and automatically close them when exiting copy mode, demonstrating a focus on efficient pane management and text editing within the tmux environment.
