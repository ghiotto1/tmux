# Purpose
The provided file contents are a configuration script for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux. This script customizes key bindings and mouse interactions within tmux sessions to enhance navigation and usability. It defines key bindings for directional navigation between panes using arrow keys and mouse wheel actions, ensuring seamless movement across different panes. Additionally, it includes a command to open a session tree for easier session management and a custom behavior for double-clicking on words, which opens the Emacs editor in a popup window, allowing for quick editing of text. The configuration also includes a command to split panes and automatically close them when exiting copy mode, optimizing the workflow within the tmux environment.
