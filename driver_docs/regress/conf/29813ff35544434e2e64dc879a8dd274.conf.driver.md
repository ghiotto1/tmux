# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux. This file customizes the behavior and appearance of tmux sessions by setting global options and key bindings. It changes the default prefix key to `C-g`, configures the status bar to appear at the top, and sets the status and mode keys to use vi-style key bindings. The configuration also specifies the base index for windows and panes to start at 1, enables focus events, and sets a large history limit for command storage. Additionally, it customizes the appearance of window and pane borders, and defines key bindings for navigation and layout management, such as joining panes in a tiled layout using function keys. The file reflects user preferences for a streamlined and efficient tmux environment tailored to specific workflow needs.
