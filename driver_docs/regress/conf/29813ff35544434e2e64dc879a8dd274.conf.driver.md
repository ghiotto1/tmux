# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux. This file customizes the behavior and appearance of tmux sessions by setting various global options and key bindings. It defines the prefix key as `C-g` and includes specific key bindings for navigation and pane management, such as joining panes and selecting layouts. The configuration also adjusts the status bar's position, appearance, and content, opting for a minimalistic approach by removing status information from the left and right sides. Additionally, it sets the history file location, clipboard integration, and history limit, enhancing the user's workflow and session management within tmux.
