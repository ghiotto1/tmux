# Purpose
This file is a configuration file for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux, specifically tailored for version 2.1 and above. It provides a narrow functionality focused on customizing the user's tmux environment by setting global options, key bindings, and integrating plugins. The file is organized into several conceptual categories, including global options, key bindings, and plugin management, all aimed at enhancing the user's terminal experience. The global options section configures various tmux behaviors such as prefix keys, terminal resizing, mouse support, and visual settings like color and status bar appearance. The key bindings section redefines default key combinations to improve navigation and pane management. The plugin manager section outlines steps to integrate and manage plugins using the tmux Plugin Manager (TPM), enhancing tmux's capabilities with additional features like session resurrection and clipboard integration. This configuration file is crucial for users who want to personalize their tmux setup, making it more efficient and tailored to their workflow within a codebase.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is designed for use with tmux version 2.1 and above, and it should be placed in the user's home directory. It provides a comprehensive setup for tmux, a terminal multiplexer, enhancing its functionality and user experience through various global options, key bindings, and plugin management.

### Global Options
- **Prefix Key**: The default prefix key is changed to the backtick (`) for command initiation.
- **Session Management**: Enables aggressive resizing to allow multiple terminals to view the same session at different sizes.
- **Vim Integration**: Optimizes interaction with Vim by removing delay when switching modes and enabling focus events, which requires the `vim-tmux-focus-events` plugin.
- **History and Color**: Increases scroll history to 50,000 lines and enables 256-color support.
- **Window and Pane Indexing**: Starts window and pane indices at 1 instead of 0 for easier navigation.
- **Mouse and Status Bar**: Enables full mouse support and configures the status bar for compatibility with the Gruvbox color scheme, including specific color settings for pane borders and window status.

### Key Bindings
- **Unbinding Defaults**: Unbinds default keys such as `C-b`, `"` (double quote), and `%`.
- **Configuration Reload**: Allows reloading of the tmux configuration with the `r` key.
- **Pane Management**: Provides key bindings for splitting panes horizontally and vertically (`h` and `v`), and for navigating between panes using `ALT` combined with arrow keys.

### Plugin Manager
The configuration includes setup instructions for the tmux Plugin Manager (TPM), which facilitates the installation and management of plugins. It outlines the steps to clone the TPM repository, reload tmux, and install plugins using the `I` key. The plugins specified include:
- **tmux-resurrect**: For saving and restoring tmux sessions.
- **tmux-yank**: For enhanced copy-paste functionality.

The configuration concludes with the initialization of TPM, ensuring that it is executed at the very end of the file to properly load and manage the specified plugins. This setup enhances tmux's usability, particularly for users who integrate it with Vim and require a more efficient terminal workflow.
