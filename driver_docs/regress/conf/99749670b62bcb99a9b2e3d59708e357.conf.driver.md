# Purpose
This file is a configuration file for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux, specifically tailored for version 2.1 and above. It is intended to be placed in the user's home directory and provides a comprehensive set of configurations to enhance the tmux user experience. The file is organized into several sections, including global options, key bindings, and plugin management, each serving a specific purpose. The global options section configures various tmux behaviors such as setting a custom prefix key, enabling mouse support, and optimizing the status bar for the Gruvbox color scheme. The key bindings section customizes keyboard shortcuts for actions like reloading the configuration and navigating between panes. The plugin manager section outlines the setup for the tmux Plugin Manager (TPM), which facilitates the installation and management of additional tmux plugins. This configuration file is crucial for users who wish to customize their tmux environment to improve productivity and tailor the interface to their preferences.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is designed for use with tmux version 2.1 and above, and it should be placed in the user's home directory. It provides a comprehensive setup for tmux, a terminal multiplexer, enhancing its functionality and user experience through various global options, key bindings, and plugin management.

### Global Options
- **Prefix Key**: The default prefix key is changed to the backtick (`) for command initiation within tmux.
- **Session Management**: Enables aggressive resizing to allow multiple terminals to view the same session at different sizes and sets the escape time to zero to remove delays when switching between Vim modes.
- **Focus and History**: Focus events are enabled to work with Vim's FocusGained feature, requiring a specific Vim plugin. The scroll history buffer is increased to 50,000 lines.
- **Terminal and Window Settings**: Color support is enabled with "screen-256color", and window titles are set to rename automatically. The base index for windows and panes starts at 1, and full mouse support is activated.
- **Status Bar and Pane Appearance**: The status bar is optimized for the Gruvbox color scheme, with specific foreground and background colors set for the status and pane borders. The current window status is displayed in bold with a specific color.

### Key Bindings
- Default key bindings for certain actions are unbound, such as the default prefix (C-b), and keys for splitting panes.
- Custom key bindings are set for reloading the tmux configuration (`r`), splitting panes horizontally (`h`) and vertically (`v`), and navigating between panes using ALT combined with arrow keys.

### Plugin Manager
The configuration includes a section for managing plugins using the tmux Plugin Manager (TPM). It outlines the steps to install TPM and fetch plugins:
1. Clone the TPM repository.
2. Reload tmux if it's already running.
3. Use the `I` key combination to install plugins.

The file specifies three plugins: `tmux-plugins/tpm`, `tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect`, and `tmux-plugins/tmux-yank`. The TPM initialization command is placed at the end of the file to ensure proper loading of the plugins.

This configuration file is designed to enhance productivity and streamline the use of tmux by customizing key bindings, enabling advanced features, and integrating useful plugins.
