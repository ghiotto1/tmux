# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux. This file is designed to customize the behavior and appearance of the tmux status bar and window status formats. It includes a conditional statement that checks the version of tmux being used, sourcing different configuration files based on whether the version is 2.6 or higher, or if it is a development version like "master" or "next". The configuration sets options for the status bar, displaying information such as the session name, host, current git branch, and git status indicators. Additionally, it configures the status-right to show system memory usage and CPU load percentage. The window status formats are customized to visually distinguish the current window and its flags, enhancing the user's ability to monitor and manage multiple sessions and panes effectively.
