# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration script for the terminal multiplexer software, tmux. This script is designed to enhance the tmux user experience by setting up conditional configurations and customizing the status bar. The `if-shell` command checks the tmux version and sources different configuration files based on whether the version is 2.6 or higher, or if it is a development version like "master" or "next". The `set-option` commands customize the appearance and information displayed in the tmux status bar, including session names, host information, current git branch, and git status indicators. Additionally, it displays system memory usage and CPU load averages, providing a comprehensive overview of the system's state directly within the tmux interface.
