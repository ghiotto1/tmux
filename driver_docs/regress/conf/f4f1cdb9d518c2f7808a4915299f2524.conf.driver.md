# Purpose
The provided configuration file is designed for a terminal multiplexer, likely tmux, and defines a custom layout management script for organizing terminal panes in a vertical split format. The script is triggered by the key binding `m-4`, which initiates the `@layout-vertical-two` command. This command checks if the layout is already active and, if not, initializes it by setting up a new window and splitting it into a vertical layout with specific pane arrangements. The `@layout-vertical-two-init` section handles the initial setup of the panes, including creating a temporary window for layout overflow and arranging panes in a specific order. The `@layout-vertical-two-loop` section ensures that the number of panes matches the original configuration, adjusting the layout dynamically until the desired structure is achieved. Finally, the `@layout-vertical-two-cleanup` section resets the environment by cleaning up temporary variables and selecting the first pane, ensuring the layout is ready for use.
