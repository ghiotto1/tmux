# Purpose
The provided configuration file is designed for a terminal multiplexer, likely tmux, to manage and automate the layout of panes within a session. It defines a custom layout named `@layout-vertical-two`, which organizes panes in a vertical split format. The configuration includes commands to initialize the layout, handle pane overflow, and clean up after the layout is applied. The `@layout-vertical-two-init` section sets up the initial state by determining the number of panes and the current window, then executes a series of commands to split and swap panes to achieve the desired layout. The `@layout-vertical-two-loop` section ensures that the number of panes is adjusted to match the original count, and if not, it continues to join and rearrange panes until the layout is complete. The cleanup section resets certain variables and marks the layout as active, ensuring the environment is ready for further operations.
