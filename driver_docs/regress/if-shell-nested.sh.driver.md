# Purpose
This shell script is designed to test the functionality of a tmux session, specifically verifying that a tmux command can execute within an if-shell condition. It provides narrow functionality, focusing on a specific use case within the tmux environment. The script sets up a temporary tmux server, executes a command to check if a condition is met, and then cleans up by removing temporary files and terminating the tmux server. It is not an executable or a library file but rather a utility script intended for testing purposes, likely used by developers or testers to ensure that tmux behaves as expected in certain scenarios. The script uses environment variables and temporary files to manage its operations and validate the test outcome.
