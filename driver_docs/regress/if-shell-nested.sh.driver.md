# Purpose
This shell script is designed to test the functionality of a tmux session, specifically focusing on the behavior of tmux when using the `if-shell` command. It is a narrow-purpose script, primarily intended for testing and validation rather than general use. The script sets up a temporary tmux server, executes a command within a tmux session, and checks if a specific condition is met by examining the output written to a temporary file. It uses environment variables and traps to manage resources and ensure cleanup after execution. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility for testing tmux configurations or behaviors in a controlled environment.
