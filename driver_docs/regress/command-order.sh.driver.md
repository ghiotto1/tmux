# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to automate the testing of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. It provides a narrow functionality focused on verifying the creation and management of `tmux` sessions and windows. The script sets up a controlled environment by defining a specific `PATH` and `TERM`, and it uses the `TEST_TMUX` variable to locate the `tmux` executable. The script then proceeds to create temporary configurations for `tmux` sessions and windows, executes them, and verifies the expected output.

The script's primary technical components include the use of `mktemp` to create a temporary file for storing `tmux` commands, and `trap` to ensure the temporary file is deleted upon script exit or interruption. It uses `tmux` commands to create sessions and windows, and `lsw` to list windows, formatting the output for comparison. The script checks the output against expected results using `cmp`, ensuring that the `tmux` sessions and windows are created as intended.

Overall, this script is a utility for testing `tmux` functionality, specifically the creation and listing of sessions and windows. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but serves as an internal tool for verifying the correct behavior of `tmux` in a controlled test environment.
