# Purpose
This shell script is a test script designed to verify the behavior of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on how it handles output redirection and pane modes. The script sets up a temporary environment, including a temporary file and a trap to clean up this file upon exit or interruption. It then runs a series of `tmux` commands to create new sessions and execute commands within them, checking the output to ensure it matches expected results. The script tests whether output is correctly redirected to a file and whether the `tmux` pane enters the expected mode, exiting with an error if any of these conditions are not met. This script provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on testing specific aspects of `tmux` behavior.
