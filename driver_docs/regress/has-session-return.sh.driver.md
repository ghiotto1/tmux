# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to test the functionality of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on session management. It provides narrow functionality, primarily checking whether the `has-session` command behaves as expected under various conditions. The script sets up the environment by defining the `PATH` and `TERM` variables and determining the path to the `tmux` executable. It then attempts to interact with `tmux` sessions, checking if a session named "foo" exists and ensuring that the `has-session` command returns the correct status code. The script is not intended to be a standalone executable or a library but rather a test script to verify the correct behavior of `tmux` session handling.
