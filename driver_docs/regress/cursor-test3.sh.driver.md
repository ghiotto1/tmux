# Purpose
This shell script is designed to test the functionality of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on cursor positioning and window resizing. It is a narrow-purpose executable script that automates the setup and execution of a series of `tmux` commands to create a new session, manipulate window sizes, and capture the output for comparison against expected results. The script uses temporary files to store test results and employs traps to ensure cleanup of these files upon exit or interruption. By comparing the captured output with a predefined result file, it verifies the correct behavior of `tmux` in handling cursor positions and window resizing, making it a useful tool for regression testing in development environments.
