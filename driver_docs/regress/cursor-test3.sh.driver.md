# Purpose
This shell script is designed to test the functionality of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on cursor positioning and window resizing. It provides narrow functionality as a test script rather than a general-purpose tool or library. The script sets up a `tmux` session with specific dimensions, executes a series of commands to manipulate the terminal display, and captures the output to a temporary file. It then compares the captured output against an expected result file (`cursor-test3.result`) to verify correct behavior. The script is intended to be executed directly, as indicated by the shebang (`#!/bin/sh`), and includes cleanup operations to remove temporary files and terminate the `tmux` server after the test completes.
