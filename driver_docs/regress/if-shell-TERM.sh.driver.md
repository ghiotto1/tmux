# Purpose
This shell script is designed to test the behavior of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer under different terminal settings. It provides narrow functionality, specifically focusing on verifying that `tmux` correctly interprets and applies terminal type settings from a configuration file. The script sets up a temporary configuration file to test how `tmux` handles different `TERM` environment variables, such as "xterm" and "screen", and checks if the expected terminal types ("vt220" and "ansi") are set accordingly. It uses a temporary file to store and verify the output of these operations, ensuring that `tmux` behaves as expected. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility for testing and validating terminal configuration behavior in `tmux`.
# Global Variables

---
### PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `PATH` variable is a global environment variable that specifies a list of directories where executable programs are located. It is used by the shell to locate binary files for execution when a command is entered without a full path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the search path for executable files, allowing the shell to find and execute commands.


---
### TERM
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TERM` variable is a global environment variable that specifies the type of terminal to emulate. In this script, it is initially set to 'screen', which is a common terminal type used in terminal multiplexers like tmux.
- **Use**: The `TERM` variable is used to determine the terminal type for the tmux sessions, affecting how terminal capabilities are interpreted and configured.


---
### TEST_TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `TEST_TMUX` is a global variable that stores the absolute path to the tmux executable. It is initialized by using the `readlink` command to resolve the path of the tmux executable located one directory up from the current script's location. If `TEST_TMUX` is not already set, it is assigned this resolved path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct the `TMUX` command with a specific server name (`-Ltest`) for testing purposes.


---
### TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMUX` variable is a string that stores the command to execute the tmux session with a specific socket name, 'test'. It is constructed by appending the string '-Ltest' to the path of the tmux executable, which is determined by the `TEST_TMUX` variable.
- **Use**: This variable is used to run tmux commands with a specific socket name for testing purposes.


---
### TMP
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMP` variable is a global variable that stores the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. This file is used to store a script that is executed by the `tmux` command to test terminal settings.
- **Use**: `TMP` is used to hold the path of a temporary file for storing and executing a script that configures and tests terminal settings in a `tmux` session.
