# Purpose
This shell script is designed to test the behavior of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer under different terminal settings. It provides narrow functionality, specifically focusing on verifying how `tmux` handles different `TERM` environment variables. The script sets up a temporary configuration file for `tmux`, executes `tmux` sessions with different terminal types (`xterm` and `screen`), and checks if the expected terminal type settings are applied correctly. It uses conditional logic to ensure that the `TERM` variable is set appropriately and verifies the output by appending results to a temporary file. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility script for testing and validation purposes within a development or testing environment.
# Global Variables

---
### PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `PATH` variable is a global environment variable that specifies a list of directories where executable programs are located. It is used by the shell to locate commands and scripts that are executed from the command line.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the search path for executable files, allowing the shell to find and execute commands without needing the full path.


---
### TERM
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TERM` variable is a global environment variable that specifies the type of terminal to emulate. It is initially set to 'screen' and is used to determine terminal capabilities and behavior within the script.
- **Use**: `TERM` is used to control terminal emulation settings and is checked and modified within the script to ensure compatibility with different terminal types.


---
### TEST_TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `TEST_TMUX` is a global variable that stores the absolute path to the tmux executable. It is initialized by using the `readlink` command to resolve the path of the tmux executable located one directory up from the current script's location.
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct the `TMUX` command with a specific socket name for testing purposes.


---
### TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMUX` variable is a string that stores the command to execute the tmux session with a specific socket name, 'test'. It is constructed by appending the string '-Ltest' to the path of the tmux executable, which is determined by the `TEST_TMUX` variable.
- **Use**: This variable is used to execute tmux commands with a specific socket name for testing purposes.


---
### TMP
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMP` variable is a global variable that stores the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. This file is used to store a script that is executed by the `tmux` command to test terminal settings.
- **Use**: `TMP` is used to hold the path of a temporary file for storing and executing a script that tests terminal configurations with `tmux`.
