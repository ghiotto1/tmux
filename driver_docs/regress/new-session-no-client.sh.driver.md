# Purpose
This shell script is designed to test the functionality of a tmux server, specifically focusing on starting a new tmux session without attaching a client, as indicated by the configuration file. The script sets up the environment by defining the PATH and TERM variables and determines the location of the tmux executable. It then creates a temporary configuration file to initiate a new tmux session with a specific name ("test") and ensures that the session starts correctly by checking its existence. The script concludes by cleaning up the temporary file and terminating any running tmux server instances. This script provides narrow functionality, primarily serving as a test utility for tmux configurations and behaviors.
# Global Variables

---
### PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `PATH` variable is a global environment variable that specifies a list of directories where executable programs are located. It is used by the shell to find and execute commands without needing to specify their full path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the search path for command execution in the shell.


---
### TERM
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TERM` variable is a global environment variable set to the value 'screen'. It is used to specify the terminal type for the shell environment.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the terminal type, which can affect how terminal-based applications behave and display output.


---
### TEST_TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `TEST_TMUX` is a global variable that stores the absolute path to the `tmux` executable. It is initialized by using the `readlink` command to resolve the path to the `tmux` executable located one directory up from the current script's location. If `TEST_TMUX` is not already set, it will be assigned this resolved path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct the `TMUX` command with a specific server name for testing purposes.


---
### TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMUX` variable is a string that holds the command to execute the tmux program with specific options. It is constructed by appending the string '-Ltest' to the path of the tmux executable, which is determined by the `TEST_TMUX` variable.
- **Use**: This variable is used to execute tmux commands with a specific server name for testing purposes.


---
### TMP
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMP` variable is a global variable that stores the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. This file is used to store a configuration script for the `tmux` command.
- **Use**: `TMP` is used to hold the path of a temporary file that is created and later removed, ensuring that the temporary file is cleaned up after the script execution.
