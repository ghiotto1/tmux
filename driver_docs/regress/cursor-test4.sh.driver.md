# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to test the functionality of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on window resizing and cursor position tracking. It is not an executable or a library file but rather a test script that automates the process of creating a `tmux` session, performing a series of window resizing operations, and capturing the cursor position and screen content at each step. The script uses temporary files to store the output and compares the results against a predefined expected output (`cursor-test4.result`) to verify correctness. This script provides narrow functionality, as it is specifically tailored to test certain aspects of `tmux` behavior, making it a useful tool for developers working on or maintaining the `tmux` project.
