# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to test the functionality of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on window resizing and cursor position tracking. It is not a general-purpose executable or a library file, but rather a specialized test script that automates the process of creating a `tmux` session, performing a series of window resizing operations, and capturing the cursor position and screen content at each step. The script uses temporary files to store the output and compares the results against a predefined expected output (`cursor-test4.result`) to verify correctness. The script is intended to be run in a testing environment where `tmux` is available, and it cleans up by removing temporary files and terminating the `tmux` server upon completion.
