# Purpose
This shell script is a test script designed to automate the testing of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on cursor positioning and window resizing functionality. It sets up a temporary `tmux` session with a specific configuration, executes a series of commands to manipulate the terminal window size, and captures the cursor position and screen content at various stages. The results are compared against a predefined expected output (`cursor-test1.result`) to verify the correctness of the `tmux` behavior. The script provides narrow functionality, as it is specifically tailored for testing `tmux` features, and it is not intended to be a reusable library or a configuration file, but rather a standalone executable script for testing purposes.
