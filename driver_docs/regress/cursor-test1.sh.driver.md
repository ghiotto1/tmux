# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to automate testing for the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on cursor positioning and window resizing functionality. It provides narrow functionality, as it is tailored to execute a specific sequence of commands to test and verify the behavior of `tmux` under certain conditions. The script sets up a temporary `tmux` session, executes a series of commands to manipulate the terminal window size, and captures the cursor position and screen content at various stages. The results are compared against expected output stored in `cursor-test1.result` to determine if the test passes. This script is not a library or a configuration file but rather an executable test script intended to be run in a shell environment to validate `tmux` behavior.
