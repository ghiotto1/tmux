# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate the testing of configuration files for the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. It provides narrow functionality, specifically targeting the execution and validation of `.conf` files located in a `conf` directory. The script sets up the environment by defining the `PATH` and `TERM` variables, and it determines the path to the `tmux` executable, defaulting to a relative path if not specified by the `TEST_TMUX` environment variable. It then iterates over each configuration file, starting a `tmux` session with a null configuration and sourcing each file to ensure they load without errors, exiting with a failure status if any configuration fails to load. This script is not an executable in the traditional sense but rather a utility script intended to be run in a testing or development environment to verify the integrity of `tmux` configuration files.
