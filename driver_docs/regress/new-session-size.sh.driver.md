# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to test the functionality of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically verifying that new sessions are created with the correct window dimensions. It provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on testing the size of `tmux` windows when sessions are initiated without clients. The script sets up the environment by defining the `PATH` and `TERM` variables, and it uses a temporary file to store the output of `tmux` commands for comparison. It runs two tests: one to check the default window size and another to verify custom dimensions, cleaning up by killing the `tmux` server and removing the temporary file after each test. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility for automated testing of specific `tmux` behavior.
