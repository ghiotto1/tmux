# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to automate testing for the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. It provides narrow functionality, specifically tailored to set up a `tmux` session, perform a series of window and pane operations, and verify the layout and state of the `tmux` environment. The script is not an executable or a library file but rather a test script that configures and manipulates `tmux` sessions to ensure they behave as expected. It uses commands to create, split, and manage windows and panes, and then compares the resulting layout against an expected output to validate the functionality. The script concludes by cleaning up the environment, ensuring no lingering `tmux` sessions remain.
