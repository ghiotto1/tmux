# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to automate testing for the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. It provides narrow functionality, specifically focused on setting up a `tmux` session, executing a series of commands to manipulate panes and windows, and then verifying the layout and state of the session. The script begins by setting up the environment and ensuring any existing `tmux` server is terminated. It then creates a temporary file to capture output and sets up a new `tmux` session with specific dimensions. The script executes a sequence of `tmux` commands to create, split, and manage panes and windows, and finally compares the resulting layout against expected output to verify correctness. This script is intended for use in a testing environment to ensure that `tmux` behaves as expected under specific conditions.
