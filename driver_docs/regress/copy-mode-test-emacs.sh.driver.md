# Purpose
This shell script is a test suite for verifying the behavior of text navigation and selection commands in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on the copy mode. It provides narrow functionality, as it is designed to test specific features of `tmux` related to word and space navigation, ensuring that commands like `previous-word`, `next-word-end`, and others behave as expected under various conditions. The script sets up a `tmux` session with a predefined text file and executes a series of commands to test how `tmux` handles word boundaries, line breaks, and special characters. It is not an executable or a library file intended for import but rather a standalone script for testing purposes, ensuring that `tmux`'s text manipulation features work correctly.
