# Purpose
This shell script is a test suite for verifying the behavior of text navigation and selection commands in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on the copy mode. It provides narrow functionality, as it is designed to test specific features of `tmux` related to word and space navigation, ensuring that commands like `previous-word`, `next-word-end`, and others behave as expected under various conditions. The script sets up a `tmux` session, executes a series of navigation commands, and checks the output against expected results to validate the correct handling of text, including edge cases like single-letter words, indented line breaks, and symbols. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a specialized testing tool intended to be run in a development or testing environment to ensure the reliability of `tmux`'s text manipulation features.
