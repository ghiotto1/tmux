# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to test the behavior of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on the termination of sessions and the associated processes. It provides narrow functionality, primarily aimed at ensuring that when a `tmux` session is killed, the processes running within that session are also terminated. The script sets up a controlled environment by defining the `PATH` and `TERM` variables, and it uses a specific `tmux` binary, potentially a test version, to create and manage sessions. It creates a new `tmux` session with a long-running `sleep` command, captures the process ID of the pane, and then verifies that killing the session also kills the process. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility for testing and validation purposes in a development or continuous integration environment.
