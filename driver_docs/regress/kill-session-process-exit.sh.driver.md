# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to test the behavior of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer, specifically focusing on the termination of sessions and the associated processes. It provides narrow functionality, primarily aimed at ensuring that when a `tmux` session is killed, the processes running within that session are also terminated. The script sets up a `tmux` environment, starts a session with a long-running process, and then verifies that killing the session results in the termination of the process. It is not an executable or a library file but rather a test script that could be part of a larger suite of tests to validate the correct behavior of `tmux` in handling session and process management.
