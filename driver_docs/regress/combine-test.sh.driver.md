# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate testing for a tmux session, specifically focusing on capturing and comparing terminal output. It sets up a tmux server with a test session, executes a series of terminal control sequences to print various characters and emojis at specific screen positions, and captures the output to a temporary file. The script then compares this captured output against a predefined result file (`combine-test.result`) to verify correctness. If the output matches, the script exits successfully; otherwise, it indicates a failure. This script provides narrow functionality, primarily serving as a test utility for validating terminal display behavior within tmux sessions.
# Global Variables

---
### PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `PATH` variable is a global environment variable that specifies a list of directories where executable programs are located. It is used by the shell to locate commands that are entered without a full path.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the search path for executable files, allowing the shell to find and execute commands located in the specified directories.


---
### TERM
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TERM` variable is a global environment variable set to the value 'screen'. It is used to specify the terminal type for the shell environment, which can affect how terminal control sequences are interpreted and displayed.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the terminal type as 'screen', which is relevant for terminal emulation and control sequences.


---
### TEST_TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `TEST_TMUX` is a global variable that holds the path to the tmux executable. It is initialized by checking if it is unset or empty, and if so, it is assigned the absolute path of the tmux executable located one directory up from the current directory.
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct the `TMUX` command with a specific socket name for testing purposes.


---
### TMUX
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMUX` variable is a string that is constructed by appending the string `-Ltest` to the value of the `TEST_TMUX` variable, which is determined by the resolved path of the `tmux` executable. This variable is used to specify a particular tmux session with the name 'test'. It is used to execute various tmux commands within the script, such as killing the server, starting a new session, and capturing output.
- **Use**: This variable is used to execute tmux commands with a specific session name throughout the script.


---
### TMP
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMP` variable is a string that holds the path to a temporary file created by the `mktemp` command. This file is used to store the output of the `tmux capturep` command for later comparison.
- **Use**: `TMP` is used to store the path of a temporary file that captures the output of a tmux session for comparison with a reference result.
