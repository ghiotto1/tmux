# Purpose
This shell script is designed to automate testing for a tmux session, specifically focusing on capturing and comparing terminal output. It provides narrow functionality, primarily serving as a test script rather than a general-purpose utility. The script sets up a tmux session with a specific configuration, executes a series of terminal commands to print various Unicode characters and sequences, and captures the output to a temporary file. It then compares this captured output against a predefined result file (`combine-test.result`) to verify the correctness of the terminal output. If the output matches, the script exits successfully; otherwise, it indicates a failure. This script is likely part of a larger suite of tests for validating terminal behavior or tmux configurations.
