# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to test the behavior of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer in different session environments. It sets up a controlled environment to verify that `tmux` correctly initializes and maintains session variables such as `TERM`, `PWD`, `PATH`, `SHELL`, and a custom `TEST` variable. The script uses temporary files to store and execute commands within new `tmux` sessions, ensuring that the environment variables are set and retrieved as expected.

The script begins by defining the `PATH` and determining the location of the `tmux` executable. It then creates temporary files to store the output and the script to be executed within the `tmux` session. The script uses `tmux` commands to start new sessions and execute a shell script that outputs the current environment variables to a temporary file. After each session, the script compares the output against expected values to verify that the environment variables are correctly set.

This script is a utility for testing and validating the behavior of `tmux` in handling environment variables across different sessions. It is not intended to be a standalone application but rather a testing tool for developers working with `tmux`. The script does not define public APIs or external interfaces; instead, it focuses on internal testing logic to ensure the reliability and correctness of `tmux` session management.
