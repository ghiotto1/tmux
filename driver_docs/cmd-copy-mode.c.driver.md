# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project, specifically implementing functionality to enter either "copy mode" or "clock mode" within a tmux session. The file defines two command entries, `cmd_copy_mode_entry` and `cmd_clock_mode_entry`, which are used to handle user commands for entering these modes. The [`cmd_copy_mode_exec`](#cmd_copy_mode_exec) function is the core execution function that processes the command arguments and determines the appropriate actions to take based on the mode specified and the options provided by the user. This function interacts with various tmux components, such as window panes and sessions, to modify their states accordingly.

The code provides a narrow functionality focused on mode switching within tmux, and it is designed to be integrated into the larger tmux codebase. It does not define a standalone executable but rather contributes to the tmux command handling system. The file includes detailed handling of command arguments, such as source and target panes, and supports various options like scrolling and mouse interactions. The use of static functions and the absence of public APIs or external interfaces suggest that this code is intended for internal use within the tmux application, encapsulating the logic for mode transitions without exposing it to external modules.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_copy_mode_entry
- **Type**: `const struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_copy_mode_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the properties and behavior of the 'copy-mode' command in the tmux application. It includes fields such as the command name, arguments, usage, source and target pane specifications, flags, and the execution function associated with the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the 'copy-mode' command, specifying how it should be executed and what options it accepts.


---
### cmd_clock_mode_entry
- **Type**: `const struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_clock_mode_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command entry for the 'clock-mode' command in the tmux application. It specifies the command's name, arguments, usage, target, flags, and the execution function associated with it.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and register the 'clock-mode' command, allowing users to enter clock mode in a tmux session.


# Functions

---
### cmd_copy_mode_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_copy_mode_exec}} -->
The `cmd_copy_mode_exec` function manages the transition of a window pane into copy or clock mode based on command arguments and events.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item being processed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve command arguments, event, source, target, and client from the provided structures.
    - Check if the 'q' argument is present; if so, reset the mode of the target window pane and return normal.
    - If the 'M' argument is present, attempt to get the window pane from the mouse event and verify the client session; return normal if unsuccessful.
    - Check if the command entry is for clock mode; if so, set the window pane to clock mode and return normal.
    - Determine the source window pane based on the presence of the 's' argument.
    - Attempt to set the window pane to copy mode; if unsuccessful and 'M' is present, start a drag operation.
    - If the 'u' argument is present, page up in the copy mode.
    - If the 'd' argument is present, page down in the copy mode, considering the 'e' argument for extended behavior.
    - If the 'S' argument is present, scroll in the copy mode using mouse slider position and event coordinates, considering the 'e' argument for extended behavior.
    - Return normal command execution status.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` indicating the result of the command execution, typically `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`.
