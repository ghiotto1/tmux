# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and defines functionality for the "kill-pane" command. The primary purpose of this file is to implement the logic required to terminate a specific pane within a tmux session. The code provides a narrow functionality focused on managing the lifecycle of panes within a tmux window. It includes the definition of a command entry structure, `cmd_kill_pane_entry`, which specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, target, flags, and the execution function [`cmd_kill_pane_exec`](#cmd_kill_pane_exec).

The [`cmd_kill_pane_exec`](#cmd_kill_pane_exec) function is the core component of this file, responsible for executing the "kill-pane" command. It checks for the presence of the '-a' argument, which indicates that all panes except the target pane should be closed. If this argument is present, the function iterates over all panes in the target window, removing and closing each one except the specified target pane. If the '-a' argument is not present, the function simply kills the specified target pane. This file is a part of the broader tmux codebase and is intended to be integrated with other components, such as command parsing and execution, to provide a cohesive user experience for managing terminal panes.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_kill_pane_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_kill_pane_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command entry for the 'kill-pane' command in the tmux application. It includes the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, target, flags, and the function to execute the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'kill-pane' command, which is responsible for terminating a specific pane within a tmux session.


# Functions

---
### cmd_kill_pane_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_kill_pane_exec}} -->
The `cmd_kill_pane_exec` function executes the command to kill a specific pane or all panes except the target pane in a tmux window.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item, which contains the target pane information.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments using `cmd_get_args(self)` and store them in `args`.
    - Get the target pane and window link using `cmdq_get_target(item)` and store them in `target`, `wl`, and `wp`.
    - Check if the '-a' flag is present in the arguments using `args_has(args, 'a')`.
    - If the '-a' flag is present, unzoom the window using `server_unzoom_window(wl->window)`.
    - Iterate over all panes in the window using `TAILQ_FOREACH_SAFE`, skipping the target pane `wp`.
    - For each non-target pane, remove it from the client using `server_client_remove_pane`, close its layout using `layout_close_pane`, and remove it from the window using `window_remove_pane`.
    - Redraw the window using `server_redraw_window(wl->window)` after removing the panes.
    - If the '-a' flag is not present, kill the target pane `wp` using `server_kill_pane(wp)`.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` value, specifically `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating the command executed successfully.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_kill_pane_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_kill_pane_exec}} -->
Kills a specified pane or all panes except one in a window.
- **Description**: This function is used to terminate a specific pane within a window or, if the '-a' flag is provided, to terminate all panes in the window except the target pane. It is typically called when a user wants to close a pane in a tmux session. The function must be called with a valid command structure and command queue item, which specify the target pane and any additional arguments. The function ensures that the window is unzoomed before removing panes if the '-a' flag is used, and it redraws the window after making changes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a 'struct cmd' that contains the command context. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to a 'struct cmdq_item' that provides the target pane and any additional arguments. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns an enum cmd_retval indicating the success of the operation, typically CMD_RETURN_NORMAL.
- **See also**: [`cmd_kill_pane_exec`](#cmd_kill_pane_exec)  (Implementation)
