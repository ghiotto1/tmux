# Purpose
This document is a comprehensive guide for managing the synchronization and release process of the "tmux" software, specifically focusing on its portable version and its integration with the OpenBSD base system version, "tmux-obsd." It provides detailed instructions on how to clone, configure, and synchronize the two repositories using Git, including setting up remotes, fetching updates, and managing branches. The document also outlines the process for creating fake history points to facilitate comparison and synchronization between the repositories. Additionally, it includes steps for performing a release of a new version of tmux, such as updating documentation, tagging the release, and building the distribution tarball. The guide is crucial for developers involved in maintaining and releasing tmux, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different operating systems and versions.
# Content Summary
This document provides a comprehensive guide for managing the synchronization and release process of the portable version of the "tmux" software, which is a terminal multiplexer. The document outlines the relationship between two repositories: "tmux" and "tmux-obsd". The "tmux" repository contains the portable version of the software, which includes code for various operating systems and uses autotools, while "tmux-obsd" is the version integrated into the OpenBSD base system. The synchronization between these repositories is crucial for maintaining the portable version's compatibility with OpenBSD updates.

Key technical details include:

1. **Repository Cloning and Configuration**: Developers are instructed to clone both repositories and configure git to track changes. The document provides commands for setting up user credentials and adding git remotes to facilitate synchronization between the repositories.

2. **Synchronization Process**: The document details the steps to fetch updates from "tmux-obsd" and integrate them into the "tmux" repository. This involves creating branches, adding fake history points to align the repositories' histories, and performing merges to incorporate changes from OpenBSD.

3. **Building and Testing**: After merging updates, developers are advised to build the software to ensure the changes are correctly integrated. This involves cleaning the build environment, running configuration scripts, and compiling the software.

4. **Release Process**: The document outlines the steps for preparing a new release of "tmux". This includes updating documentation files like README and CHANGES, adjusting version numbers in configuration files, tagging the release in git, and building a distribution tarball. Developers are also instructed to update the tmux.github.io repository to reflect the new release.

5. **Monitoring Dependencies**: Special attention is given to the "compat/" code, which relies on OpenBSD's libutil, particularly the imsg API. Developers are advised to monitor changes in libutil to ensure compatibility with the portable version of tmux.

Overall, this document serves as a detailed procedural guide for developers to manage the synchronization and release of the portable tmux version, ensuring it remains up-to-date with the OpenBSD base system while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.
