# Purpose
The provided file is a configuration file for a continuous integration (CI) system, likely Travis CI, which is used to automate the building and testing of a software project. It specifies the environment matrix for the CI jobs, detailing the combinations of operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, OSX), compilers (GCC, Clang), and architectures (amd64, arm64) to be used. The `env` section defines different build configurations, such as static and musl builds. The `jobs` section includes exclusions to prevent certain combinations from being executed, such as static builds on OSX and musl builds on FreeBSD and OSX, due to known issues. The `before_install` and `script` sections specify shell scripts to be run before the installation and during the build process, respectively, ensuring that necessary setup and build commands are executed in the CI environment.
