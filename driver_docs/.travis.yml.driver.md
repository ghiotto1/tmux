# Purpose
The provided file is a configuration file for a continuous integration (CI) system, likely Travis CI, which is used to automate the building and testing of a software project. It specifies the environments in which the software should be built and tested, including different operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, OSX), compilers (GCC, Clang), and architectures (amd64, arm64). The file also defines various build environments through the `env` variable, such as static and musl builds. Certain combinations of operating systems, compilers, architectures, and build environments are explicitly excluded from the build process due to known issues, such as static builds being broken on OSX or the absence of musl on FreeBSD and OSX. The `before_install` and `script` sections specify shell scripts to be executed before the installation and during the build process, respectively, ensuring that necessary setup and build commands are run in the CI environment.
