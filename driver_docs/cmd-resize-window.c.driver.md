# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and provides functionality for resizing windows within a tmux session. The file defines a command, `resize-window`, which can be used to adjust the size of a window either by specifying exact dimensions or by incrementally increasing or decreasing the size. The command supports various options, such as adjusting the width or height directly, or resizing in specific directions (left, right, up, down). It also includes options to automatically adjust the window size to the largest or smallest possible dimensions within the session.

The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`cmd_resize_window_exec`](#cmd_resize_window_exec) function, which processes command-line arguments to determine the desired window size adjustments. It uses helper functions to parse and validate these arguments, ensuring that the specified dimensions are within acceptable limits. The command is registered with a command entry structure, `cmd_resize_window_entry`, which defines its name, alias, arguments, usage, and execution function. This file is a focused component of the tmux codebase, providing a specific feature related to window management, and is intended to be integrated into the larger tmux application rather than serving as a standalone executable.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_resize_window_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_resize_window_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for resizing a window in the tmux application. It includes the command name, alias, argument specifications, usage instructions, target specifications, flags, and the function to execute the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'resize-window' command within the tmux application, allowing users to adjust window sizes.


# Functions

---
### cmd_resize_window_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_resize_window_exec}} -->
The `cmd_resize_window_exec` function adjusts the size of a window in a session based on specified arguments or defaults.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments using [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args) and the target window using [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target).
    - Initialize the adjustment value to 1 if no arguments are provided, otherwise parse the adjustment value from the arguments.
    - Set the initial window size `sx` and `sy` to the current window's size.
    - If the 'x' argument is present, parse and set the window's width `sx` within defined limits, returning an error if invalid.
    - If the 'y' argument is present, parse and set the window's height `sy` within defined limits, returning an error if invalid.
    - Adjust the window's width or height based on the presence of 'L', 'R', 'U', or 'D' arguments, modifying `sx` or `sy` accordingly.
    - If the 'A' argument is present, set the window size to the largest default size; if 'a' is present, set it to the smallest default size.
    - Set the window's size options to manual and update the window's manual size attributes `manual_sx` and `manual_sy`.
    - Recalculate the window size using [`recalculate_size`](resize.c.driver.md#recalculate_size).
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**:
    - Returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` on successful execution or `CMD_RETURN_ERROR` if an error occurs during argument parsing.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args)
    - [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target)
    - [`args_count`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_count)
    - [`strtonum`](compat/strtonum.c.driver.md#strtonum)
    - [`args_string`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_string)
    - [`args_has`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_has)
    - [`args_strtonum`](arguments.c.driver.md#args_strtonum)
    - [`default_window_size`](resize.c.driver.md#default_window_size)
    - [`options_set_number`](options.c.driver.md#options_set_number)
    - [`recalculate_size`](resize.c.driver.md#recalculate_size)
