# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and provides functionality for resizing windows within a tmux session. The file defines a command, `resize-window`, which can be used to adjust the dimensions of a window either by specifying exact dimensions or by incrementally increasing or decreasing the size. The command is implemented through the [`cmd_resize_window_exec`](#cmd_resize_window_exec) function, which processes command-line arguments to determine the desired adjustments. It supports various options, such as setting specific width and height, or adjusting the size in different directions (left, right, up, down). Additionally, it can automatically resize the window to the largest or smallest possible size based on the current session's constraints.

The file is structured to integrate with the tmux command framework, as evidenced by the `cmd_entry` structure that defines the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, and execution function. This structure allows the command to be registered and executed within the tmux environment. The code handles input validation, ensuring that the specified dimensions are within acceptable limits, and provides error messages for invalid inputs. The resizing logic is encapsulated in the [`cmd_resize_window_exec`](#cmd_resize_window_exec) function, which updates the window's size and recalculates its layout. This file is a focused component of the tmux codebase, providing a specific utility for window management within the broader context of terminal multiplexing.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_resize_window_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_resize_window_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for resizing a window in the tmux application. It includes the command name, alias, argument specifications, usage instructions, target specifications, flags, and the execution function associated with the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'resize-window' command within the tmux application, allowing users to adjust window sizes.


# Functions

---
### cmd_resize_window_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_resize_window_exec}} -->
The `cmd_resize_window_exec` function adjusts the size of a window in a session based on specified arguments or defaults.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments using `cmd_get_args` and the target window using `cmdq_get_target`.
    - Initialize the adjustment value to 1 if no arguments are provided, otherwise parse the adjustment value from the arguments.
    - Set the initial window size `sx` and `sy` from the current window dimensions.
    - Check for specific arguments ('x', 'y', 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D', 'A', 'a') to adjust the window size accordingly.
    - If 'x' or 'y' arguments are present, parse and set the window dimensions, handling errors if the values are out of bounds.
    - Adjust the window size based on directional arguments ('L', 'R', 'U', 'D') by increasing or decreasing the size by the adjustment value.
    - If 'A' or 'a' arguments are present, set the window size to the largest or smallest default size, respectively.
    - Set the window size option to manual and update the window's manual size attributes.
    - Recalculate the window size with the new dimensions.
- **Output**:
    - Returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` on successful execution or `CMD_RETURN_ERROR` if an error occurs during argument parsing.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_resize_window_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_resize_window_exec}} -->
Adjusts the size of a specified window.
- **Description**: This function is used to change the dimensions of a specified window within a session. It can increase or decrease the window size based on the provided arguments. The function supports direct resizing to specific dimensions or relative adjustments using flags. It must be called with a valid command and target item, and it handles errors by returning an error status if invalid parameters are provided. The function also supports setting the window size to the largest or smallest possible dimensions using specific flags.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the command structure representing the resize-window command. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to the command queue item that contains the target window information. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns an enum value indicating the success or failure of the resize operation. CMD_RETURN_NORMAL on success, CMD_RETURN_ERROR on failure due to invalid parameters.
- **See also**: [`cmd_resize_window_exec`](#cmd_resize_window_exec)  (Implementation)
