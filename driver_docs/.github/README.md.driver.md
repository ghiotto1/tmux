# Purpose
This document is a README file for the software "tmux," a terminal multiplexer that allows multiple terminal sessions to be managed from a single interface. The file provides comprehensive information about the software's dependencies, installation methods, contribution guidelines, documentation resources, and support channels. It outlines the necessary tools and libraries required to build tmux, such as libevent, ncurses, and a C compiler, and offers instructions for installation from binary packages, release tarballs, or directly from version control. Additionally, it encourages community involvement through bug reports and code contributions, providing contact information and links to further resources. The README serves as an essential guide for users and developers interacting with the tmux codebase, ensuring they have the necessary information to install, use, and contribute to the project effectively.
# Content Summary
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and users working with tmux, a terminal multiplexer that allows multiple terminal sessions to be managed from a single screen. It provides essential information on the dependencies, installation methods, contribution guidelines, documentation resources, and support channels for tmux.

### Key Technical Details:

1. **Dependencies**: tmux requires `libevent` 2.x and `ncurses` for its operation. These libraries are crucial for handling events and terminal screen management, respectively. Additionally, building tmux necessitates a C compiler (such as gcc or clang), make, pkg-config, and a suitable yacc (yacc or bison).

2. **Installation**:
   - **Binary Packages**: Some platforms offer binary packages, though they may not always be up-to-date. A list of these platforms is available on the tmux GitHub wiki.
   - **From Release Tarball**: Users can build and install tmux using the `./configure && make` command sequence followed by `sudo make install`. The optional `--enable-utempter` flag can be used during configuration to enable utmp updates if the utempter library is installed.
   - **From Version Control**: For the latest version, developers can clone the tmux repository and build it using `autoconf`, `automake`, and `pkg-config`.

3. **Contributing**: The document encourages contributions in the form of bug reports, feature suggestions, and code contributions. It directs contributors to the tmux-users mailing list or GitHub for issues and pull requests, emphasizing the importance of reading the CONTRIBUTING.md document beforehand.

4. **Documentation**: Users can access the tmux.1 manpage for detailed usage instructions. An example configuration file (`example_tmux.conf`) and a bash completion script are also provided. For debugging, tmux can be run with `-v` or `-vv` to generate log files.

5. **Support**: The tmux-users Google Group serves as the primary support channel for discussions and bug reports. Users can subscribe to the mailing list for updates and community interaction.

This document is essential for anyone looking to install, use, or contribute to tmux, providing clear instructions and resources to facilitate these processes.
