# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML format. This file defines a workflow named "Lock Threads" that is scheduled to run daily at midnight, as specified by the cron expression '0 0 * * *'. The workflow can also be manually triggered using the `workflow_dispatch` event. It grants write permissions to issues, pull requests, and discussions, allowing the workflow to modify these resources. The workflow consists of a single job that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and utilizes the `dessant/lock-threads@v5` action. This action automatically locks issues, pull requests, and discussions that have been inactive for a specified number of days (30 days for issues and 60 days for pull requests and discussions), adding a comment to notify users of the lock due to inactivity.
