# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML format. This file defines a workflow named "Lock Threads" that is scheduled to run daily at midnight, as specified by the cron expression '0 0 * * *'. The workflow can also be triggered manually via the `workflow_dispatch` event. It grants write permissions to issues, pull requests, and discussions, allowing the workflow to modify these resources. The workflow runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and utilizes the `dessant/lock-threads@v5` action to automatically lock issues, pull requests, and discussions that have been inactive for a specified number of days (30 days for issues and 60 days for pull requests and discussions). Custom comments are added to each locked item to inform users about the automatic locking due to inactivity.
