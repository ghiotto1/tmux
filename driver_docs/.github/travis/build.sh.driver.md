# Purpose
This code is a shell script designed to automate the build process for a software project, providing a narrow but essential functionality. It is not an executable or a library file but rather a build script that orchestrates the configuration and compilation of the project based on different build options. The script begins by running `autogen.sh`, a common step in projects using GNU Autotools, and then uses a `case` statement to handle different build scenarios, such as static builds or builds using the musl C library. Depending on the value of the `BUILD` environment variable, it configures the build environment accordingly and then executes `make` to compile the project. This script is crucial for developers to ensure consistent and repeatable builds across different environments and configurations.
