# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to automate the build process of a software project. It provides a narrow functionality focused on configuring and compiling the project based on different build configurations specified by the `BUILD` environment variable. The script first runs `autogen.sh` to prepare the build environment, and then uses a `case` statement to handle different build scenarios such as `static`, `all`, `musl`, and `musl-static`, each of which configures the build environment accordingly and then executes `make` to compile the project. This script is not an executable or a library file but rather a build automation tool that simplifies the process of setting up and compiling the software under various conditions.
