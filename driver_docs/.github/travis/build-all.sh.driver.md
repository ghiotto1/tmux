# Purpose
The provided script is a shell script designed to automate the process of downloading, configuring, building, and installing two software libraries: Libevent and Ncurses. It begins by setting a build directory and then proceeds to download the specified versions of these libraries from their respective URLs. The script uses `wget` to fetch the tarball files, extracts them using `tar`, and then configures each library with specific options tailored to the build environment, such as enabling shared libraries and disabling unnecessary components. After configuring, it compiles and installs the libraries into the designated build directory. The script concludes by running an `autogen.sh` script, configuring the environment with `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, and executing the final build and installation steps, ensuring that any errors are logged and the process exits gracefully if any step fails.
