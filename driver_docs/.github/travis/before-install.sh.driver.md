# Purpose
This code is a shell script designed to automate the installation of necessary development tools and libraries on different operating systems, specifically Linux and FreeBSD, within a Travis CI environment. It provides narrow functionality focused on setting up the build environment by checking the operating system type and conditionally installing packages required for building software projects. The script uses conditional statements to determine the operating system and then executes the appropriate package management commands to install dependencies such as `bison`, `libevent-dev`, and `pkg-config` on Linux, and `automake` and `libevent` on FreeBSD. This script is typically used in continuous integration pipelines to ensure that the build environment is correctly configured before compiling or testing software.
