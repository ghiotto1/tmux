# Purpose
This script is a shell script intended for use in a continuous integration (CI) environment, specifically with Travis CI, to set up the necessary build environment on different operating systems. It provides narrow functionality focused on installing dependencies required for building software projects on Linux and FreeBSD systems. The script checks the operating system type using the `TRAVIS_OS_NAME` environment variable and installs a set of development tools and libraries accordingly. For Linux, it installs packages like `bison`, `libncurses5-dev`, and `build-essential`, and conditionally installs `musl-dev` and `musl-tools` if the build type is specified as "musl" or "musl-static". For FreeBSD, it installs packages such as `automake` and `libevent`. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a configuration script to prepare the build environment.
