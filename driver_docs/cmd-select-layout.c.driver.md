# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the `tmux` project, a terminal multiplexer that allows users to switch between several programs in one terminal. The file defines functionality for managing window layouts within `tmux` sessions. Specifically, it provides commands to select, switch to the next, or revert to the previous window layout. The file includes the implementation of the [`cmd_select_layout_exec`](#cmd_select_layout_exec) function, which executes the logic for these commands. This function handles various command-line arguments to determine the desired layout operation, such as selecting a specific layout by name, switching to the next or previous layout, or spreading out panes within a window.

The file defines three command entries: `select-layout`, `next-layout`, and `previous-layout`, each associated with the [`cmd_select_layout_exec`](#cmd_select_layout_exec) function. These entries specify the command names, aliases, argument structures, usage information, and execution logic. The code is designed to be integrated into the broader `tmux` application, providing a modular approach to layout management. It does not define a public API but rather contributes to the internal command handling mechanism of `tmux`, allowing users to manipulate window layouts through the command-line interface.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_select_layout_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_select_layout_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command 'select-layout' and its alias 'selectl'. It specifies the arguments, usage, target, flags, and execution function associated with the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'select-layout' command within the application, allowing users to switch the window to a selected layout.


---
### cmd_next_layout_entry
- **Type**: `const struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_next_layout_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for switching to the next window layout in the tmux application. It specifies the command name as "next-layout" with an alias "nextl", and includes argument specifications, usage instructions, target specifications, and execution flags. The command is executed using the `cmd_select_layout_exec` function.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'next-layout' command in tmux, allowing users to switch to the next window layout.


---
### cmd_previous_layout_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_previous_layout_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for switching to the previous layout in a window management application. It includes fields such as the command name, alias, arguments, usage, target, flags, and the execution function. This structure is part of a command system that allows users to manipulate window layouts.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'previous-layout' command, which switches the current window to its previous layout configuration.


# Functions

---
### cmd_select_layout_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_select_layout_exec}} -->
The `cmd_select_layout_exec` function changes the layout of a window in a terminal multiplexer based on specified arguments or commands.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments and target window and pane from the command queue item.
    - Unzoom the target window if it is zoomed.
    - Determine if the command is for the next or previous layout based on the command entry or arguments.
    - Store the current layout of the window and update it with the new layout.
    - If the command is for the next or previous layout, set the window to the next or previous layout and proceed to the 'changed' label.
    - If the 'E' argument is present, spread out the layout of the target pane and proceed to the 'changed' label.
    - Determine the layout name from the arguments or use the old layout if the 'o' argument is present.
    - If the layout name is not specified, use the last layout or look up the layout by name and select it if found, then proceed to the 'changed' label.
    - If a layout name is specified, parse it and handle errors if parsing fails, otherwise proceed to the 'changed' label.
    - Free the old layout and return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` if no changes were made.
    - At the 'changed' label, free the old layout, recalculate sizes, redraw the window, notify of layout change, and return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`.
    - At the 'error' label, restore the old layout, free the new layout, and return `CMD_RETURN_ERROR`.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` which is either `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` if the layout change was successful or `CMD_RETURN_ERROR` if there was an error.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_select_layout_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_select_layout_exec}} -->
Switches the window to a specified layout.
- **Description**: This function is used to change the layout of a window in a tmux session. It can switch to a specific layout by name, move to the next or previous layout, or spread out the panes within the current layout. The function should be called when a layout change is desired, and it requires a valid command and command queue item. It handles various layout options and ensures the window is redrawn if the layout changes. The function must be called with a valid command and command queue item, and it will return an error if the layout name is invalid or if any other error occurs during layout parsing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the command structure representing the current command. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to the command queue item associated with the command execution. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns CMD_RETURN_NORMAL on successful layout change or CMD_RETURN_ERROR if an error occurs, such as an invalid layout name.
- **See also**: [`cmd_select_layout_exec`](#cmd_select_layout_exec)  (Implementation)
