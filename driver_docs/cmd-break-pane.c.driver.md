# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and implements the functionality for the "break-pane" command. The primary purpose of this code is to allow users to detach a pane from an existing window and create a new window with that pane. This functionality is encapsulated in the [`cmd_break_pane_exec`](#cmd_break_pane_exec) function, which handles the logic for breaking a pane off into a separate window, managing the session and window states, and updating the user interface accordingly.

The code defines a command entry structure, `cmd_break_pane_entry`, which specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, and execution function. The execution function, [`cmd_break_pane_exec`](#cmd_break_pane_exec), performs several operations, such as checking command arguments, managing pane and window layouts, and updating session and window states. It also handles error conditions, such as when a specified index is already in use. The code is designed to be integrated into the larger tmux application, providing a specific feature within the broader context of terminal multiplexing.

- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_break_pane_entry
- **Type**: `const struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_break_pane_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command entry for the 'break-pane' command in the tmux application. It includes the command's name, alias, argument specifications, usage instructions, source and target specifications, flags, and the function to execute the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'break-pane' command, which allows a pane to be broken off into a separate window in tmux.


# Functions

---
### cmd_break_pane_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_break_pane_exec}} -->
The `cmd_break_pane_exec` function detaches a pane from its current window and creates a new window for it, optionally renaming it and adjusting its position in the session.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve command arguments and current, target, and source states from the command queue item.
    - Determine if the pane should be inserted before or after the target index based on the presence of 'b' or 'a' flags.
    - If the window has only one pane, link it to the destination session and optionally rename it, then unlink it from the source session.
    - Check if the target index is already in use and return an error if so.
    - Remove the pane from its current window and adjust the layout.
    - Create a new window for the pane and set its options and flags.
    - Set the window name based on the presence of the 'n' flag or use a default name.
    - Initialize the layout for the new window and set the pane's color palette.
    - Attach the new window to the destination session at the specified index.
    - Redraw the source and destination sessions and update their status.
    - If the 'P' flag is present, format and print the pane information using the specified or default template.
- **Output**:
    - Returns `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` on success or `CMD_RETURN_ERROR` if an error occurs during execution.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_break_pane_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_break_pane_exec}} -->
Breaks a pane off into a separate window.
- **Description**: This function is used to detach a pane from its current window and create a new window with that pane. It should be called when a user wants to reorganize panes into separate windows. The function requires a valid command structure and command queue item, and it handles various options such as renaming the new window, specifying the destination window, and determining the position of the new window. It also manages error conditions like index conflicts and ensures the user interface is updated accordingly.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a struct cmd representing the command to be executed. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to a struct cmdq_item representing the command queue item. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns an enum cmd_retval indicating success (CMD_RETURN_NORMAL) or failure (CMD_RETURN_ERROR).
- **See also**: [`cmd_break_pane_exec`](#cmd_break_pane_exec)  (Implementation)
