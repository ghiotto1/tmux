# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux project, a terminal multiplexer, and it provides specialized functionality for handling UTF-8 encoded data. The file defines several functions that analyze UTF-8 data to determine specific characteristics, such as whether a given sequence contains or is a zero-width joiner (ZWJ), a variation selector, or a modifier. These functions are essential for correctly interpreting and rendering complex text sequences, particularly those involving emoji or other characters that require combining multiple code points to display correctly. The functions use the `utf8_data` structure, which likely encapsulates UTF-8 encoded text, and they perform operations like memory comparison and character conversion to wide characters to achieve their goals.

The file is not a standalone executable but rather a component of a larger system, likely intended to be included in other parts of the tmux codebase. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but instead provides internal utility functions that other parts of the tmux application can use to handle UTF-8 text. The presence of specific checks for zero-width joiners, variation selectors, and modifiers indicates a focus on ensuring that text rendering and manipulation within tmux are accurate and visually consistent, especially when dealing with complex character sequences.

# Functions

---
### utf8_has_zwj<!-- {{#callable:utf8_has_zwj}} -->
The function `utf8_has_zwj` checks if a given UTF-8 encoded string ends with a zero width joiner (ZWJ) character.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ud`: A pointer to a `utf8_data` structure, which contains the UTF-8 encoded string data and its size.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the size of the UTF-8 data is less than 3; if so, return 0 indicating no ZWJ is present.
    - Use `memcmp` to compare the last three bytes of the UTF-8 data with the byte sequence representing the ZWJ character ('\342\200\215').
    - Return 1 if the comparison is equal, indicating the presence of a ZWJ at the end, otherwise return 0.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an integer: 1 if the UTF-8 data ends with a zero width joiner, otherwise 0.


---
### utf8_is_zwj<!-- {{#callable:utf8_is_zwj}} -->
The function `utf8_is_zwj` checks if a given UTF-8 encoded data represents a zero width joiner (ZWJ) character.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ud`: A pointer to a `utf8_data` structure containing UTF-8 encoded data to be checked.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the size of the UTF-8 data is exactly 3 bytes; if not, return 0 (false).
    - Compare the 3-byte data with the byte sequence representing the ZWJ character (`\342\200\215`); if they match, return 1 (true), otherwise return 0 (false).
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an integer: 1 if the data represents a zero width joiner, and 0 otherwise.


---
### utf8_is_vs<!-- {{#callable:utf8_is_vs}} -->
The function `utf8_is_vs` checks if a given UTF-8 encoded data represents a variation selector character.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ud`: A pointer to a `struct utf8_data` which contains the UTF-8 encoded data to be checked.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the size of the UTF-8 data is exactly 3 bytes; if not, return 0 (false).
    - Compare the 3-byte data with the specific byte sequence for a variation selector ("\357\270\217").
    - Return 1 (true) if the data matches the variation selector sequence, otherwise return 0 (false).
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an integer: 1 if the data is a variation selector, and 0 otherwise.


---
### utf8_is_modifier<!-- {{#callable:utf8_is_modifier}} -->
The function `utf8_is_modifier` checks if a given UTF-8 encoded character is a modifier by comparing it against a predefined set of Unicode code points.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ud`: A pointer to a `utf8_data` structure representing the UTF-8 encoded character to be checked.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Convert the UTF-8 data to a wide character using `utf8_towc` function and store the result in `wc`.
    - Check if the conversion was successful by comparing the result to `UTF8_DONE`. If not, return 0.
    - Use a switch statement to compare the wide character `wc` against a list of predefined Unicode code points that represent modifiers.
    - If `wc` matches any of the predefined code points, return 1 indicating the character is a modifier.
    - If no match is found, return 0 indicating the character is not a modifier.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an integer: 1 if the character is a modifier, and 0 otherwise.
