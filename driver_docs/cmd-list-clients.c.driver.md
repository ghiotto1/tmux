# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and provides functionality to list all connected clients. The file defines a command, `list-clients`, which can be executed within the tmux environment to display information about each client connected to a tmux server. The command is implemented with a specific template that formats the output to include details such as the client name, session name, terminal dimensions, and user information. The code is structured to allow filtering and formatting of the output through command-line arguments, enhancing its flexibility and usability.

The file includes a command entry structure, `cmd_list_clients_entry`, which defines the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, and execution function. The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`cmd_list_clients_exec`](#cmd_list_clients_exec) function, which iterates over the list of clients, applies any specified filters, and formats the output according to the provided or default template. This function utilizes a format tree to manage the dynamic construction of output strings, ensuring that the information is presented in a user-friendly manner. The code is designed to be integrated into the broader tmux application, providing a specific utility within the context of session and client management.

# Global Variables

---
### cmd_list_clients_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_list_clients_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for listing all clients in the tmux environment. It includes the command name, alias, arguments, usage instructions, target specifications, flags, and the execution function associated with the command. This structure is used to register and handle the 'list-clients' command within the tmux application.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'list-clients' command in tmux, allowing users to list all connected clients with optional formatting and filtering.


# Functions

---
### cmd_list_clients_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_list_clients_exec}} -->
The `cmd_list_clients_exec` function lists all connected clients, optionally filtered and formatted according to specified arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve command arguments using [`cmd_get_args`](cmd.c.driver.md#cmd_get_args) and target session using [`cmdq_get_target`](cmd-queue.c.driver.md#cmdq_get_target).
    - Check if the '-t' argument is present to determine if a specific session is targeted.
    - Set the template for formatting output using the '-F' argument or default to `LIST_CLIENTS_TEMPLATE`.
    - Retrieve the filter expression using the '-f' argument, if provided.
    - Initialize an index counter `idx` to zero.
    - Iterate over all clients using `TAILQ_FOREACH`.
    - For each client, check if it is associated with a session and matches the target session if specified.
    - Create a format tree for the current client and add default formatting values.
    - If a filter is specified, expand it using the format tree and evaluate its truth value.
    - If the filter evaluates to true or is not specified, expand the template using the format tree and print the formatted line.
    - Free the format tree and increment the index counter.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` value, specifically `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating successful execution.
