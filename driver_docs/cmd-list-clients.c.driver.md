# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the tmux terminal multiplexer project and is responsible for implementing the functionality to list all connected clients. The code defines a command, `list-clients`, which can be executed within the tmux environment to display information about each client connected to a tmux server. The command is defined with options for specifying a format (`-F`) and a filter (`-f`), allowing users to customize the output. The command can also target a specific session using the `-t` option.

The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`cmd_list_clients_exec`](#cmd_list_clients_exec) function, which iterates over all clients connected to the tmux server. For each client, it checks if the client is associated with a session and whether it matches the specified target session. It uses a format tree to apply the specified format and filter, expanding these to generate the output line for each client. The output includes details such as the client name, session name, terminal dimensions, and user information. The code is structured to be part of a larger tmux command framework, as indicated by the use of structures like `cmd_entry` and functions like `cmd_get_args` and `cmdq_print`, which are likely part of the tmux command execution infrastructure.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `sys/types.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `string.h`
- `time.h`
- `tmux.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cmd_list_clients_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_list_clients_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for listing all clients in the tmux application. It includes the command name, alias, arguments, usage information, target session, flags, and the execution function. This structure is used to register and handle the 'list-clients' command within the tmux command framework.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'list-clients' command in tmux, allowing users to list all connected clients with optional formatting and filtering.


# Functions

---
### cmd_list_clients_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_list_clients_exec}} -->
The `cmd_list_clients_exec` function lists all connected clients, optionally filtered and formatted according to specified arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve command arguments using `cmd_get_args` and target session using `cmdq_get_target`.
    - Check if the '-t' argument is present to determine if a specific session is targeted.
    - Set the template for formatting output using the '-F' argument or default to `LIST_CLIENTS_TEMPLATE`.
    - Retrieve the filter expression using the '-f' argument, if provided.
    - Initialize an index counter `idx` to zero.
    - Iterate over each client in the global `clients` list using `TAILQ_FOREACH`.
    - For each client, check if it is associated with a session and matches the target session if specified.
    - Create a format tree `ft` for the current client and add default formatting variables.
    - If a filter is specified, expand it using the format tree and evaluate its truth value to determine if the client should be listed.
    - If the client passes the filter (or no filter is specified), expand the template using the format tree and print the formatted line.
    - Free the format tree and increment the index counter.
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns an `enum cmd_retval` value, specifically `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL`, indicating successful execution.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### cmd_list_clients_exec<!-- {{#callable_declaration:cmd_list_clients_exec}} -->
Lists all connected clients with optional filtering and formatting.
- **Description**: This function is used to list all clients currently connected to the server, optionally filtered by a specified session and formatted according to a given template. It is typically called when a user wants to view information about active clients, such as their session names, dimensions, and terminal types. The function can apply a filter to include only clients that match certain criteria and format the output using a specified template. It must be called with a valid command and command queue item, and it respects the target session if specified.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the command structure representing the current command. Must not be null.
    - `item`: A pointer to the command queue item structure, which provides context for the command execution. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns CMD_RETURN_NORMAL to indicate successful execution.
- **See also**: [`cmd_list_clients_exec`](#cmd_list_clients_exec)  (Implementation)
