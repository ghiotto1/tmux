# Purpose
This file is a README document for the software "tmux," a terminal multiplexer. It provides detailed instructions on how to build and install tmux from source, including dependencies such as libevent and ncurses, and the necessary tools like a C compiler and make. The document also offers guidance on obtaining the latest version from the repository, contributing to the project, and accessing further documentation and support. The content is focused on installation and contribution processes, making it a crucial resource for developers and users who wish to compile tmux themselves or participate in its development. The file is relevant to the codebase as it outlines the foundational steps required to set up and engage with the tmux project.
# Content Summary
This document provides comprehensive instructions and information for working with tmux, a terminal multiplexer that allows users to create and manage multiple terminal sessions within a single screen. It is compatible with various operating systems, including OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, macOS, and Solaris. The document outlines the dependencies required for building tmux, specifically libevent 2.x and ncurses, and provides links to download these libraries.

For building and installing tmux from a tarball, the document provides a simple command sequence: `./configure && make` followed by `sudo make install`. It also mentions the optional use of utempter for updating utmp(5) with the `--enable-utempter` option if utempter is installed.

To obtain the latest version of tmux from the repository, users are instructed to clone the GitHub repository and execute a series of commands to build the software, which requires additional tools such as a C compiler, make, autoconf, automake, and pkg-config.

The document also provides resources for further information and support, including links to the tmux GitHub repository, mailing lists for discussions and bug reports, and instructions for accessing the tmux manual using the `nroff` command. It highlights the availability of a sample configuration file and a bash-completion file for enhanced user experience.

Debugging options are available by specifying `-v` or `-vv`, which generate server and client log files in the current directory. The document encourages contributions and bug reports, providing contact information for the tmux-users mailing list and emphasizing the open nature of the project under the ISC license. The document is authored by Nicholas Marriott, whose contact information is provided for further inquiries.
