# Content Summary
This document provides comprehensive instructions and information for working with tmux, a terminal multiplexer that allows users to create and manage multiple terminal sessions within a single screen. It is compatible with various operating systems, including OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, macOS, and Solaris. The document outlines the dependencies required for building tmux, specifically libevent 2.x and ncurses, and provides links to download these libraries.

For building and installing tmux from a tarball, the document provides a simple command sequence: `./configure && make` followed by `sudo make install`. It also mentions the optional use of utempter for updating utmp(5) with the `--enable-utempter` option if utempter is installed.

To obtain the latest version of tmux from the repository, users are instructed to clone the GitHub repository and execute a series of commands to configure and build the software. The document specifies additional build requirements, including a C compiler, make, autoconf, automake, and pkg-config.

The document also provides resources for further information and support, such as the tmux manual (`tmux.1`), sample configuration files, and bash-completion scripts. Debugging options are available with the `-v` or `-vv` flags, which generate log files in the current directory.

For community engagement, the document lists mailing lists for discussions, bug reports, and git commit notifications, along with instructions for subscribing. Contributions, particularly in the form of bug reports and feature requests, are encouraged and can be submitted via email or GitHub issues.

Finally, the document notes that it, along with other specified files, is protected under the ISC license, with licensing details for other files provided at the top of each file. The document is authored by Nicholas Marriott, whose contact information is included.
