# Purpose
The provided content is a README file for the software "tmux," a terminal multiplexer that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single interface. This document outlines the dependencies required for building tmux, such as libevent and ncurses, and provides instructions for installation from both a release tarball and the latest version from version control. It also encourages community contributions through bug reports, feature suggestions, and code contributions, directing users to email or GitHub for participation. Additionally, the README offers resources for documentation, including the manpage, example configurations, and a wiki, and provides support information through a mailing list. The licensing section clarifies that the README and CHANGES files are under the ISC license, with other files containing their respective license notices.
