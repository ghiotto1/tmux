# Purpose
The provided content is a README file for the software "tmux," a terminal multiplexer that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single interface. This document outlines the dependencies required for building tmux, such as libevent and ncurses, and provides instructions for installation from both a release tarball and the latest version from version control. It also includes information on contributing to the project, accessing documentation, and obtaining support through mailing lists and forums. Additionally, the README specifies the licensing terms under which the software is distributed, highlighting the ISC license for this file and the CHANGES files, while other files contain their own license notices.
