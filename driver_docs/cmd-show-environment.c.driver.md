# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the `tmux` terminal multiplexer project and implements the functionality for the `show-environment` command. The primary purpose of this file is to define and execute the command that displays environment variables within a `tmux` session. The command can be invoked with various options to control its behavior, such as showing hidden variables, targeting a specific session, or displaying variables in a shell-compatible format. The file includes functions to escape special characters in environment variable values and to print these variables in different formats based on the command-line arguments provided.

The code defines a command entry structure, `cmd_show_environment_entry`, which specifies the command's name, alias, arguments, usage, and execution function. The execution function, [`cmd_show_environment_exec`](#cmd_show_environment_exec), handles the logic for retrieving and displaying environment variables from either the global environment or a specific session's environment. It checks for the presence of a target session and processes command-line arguments to determine which variables to display and how to format them. The file also includes utility functions for escaping variable values and printing them, ensuring that the output is correctly formatted for the user's needs. This code is a focused component of the `tmux` project, providing a specific command functionality within the broader context of session management and environment handling.

### cmd_show_environment_escape
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `cmd_show_environment_escape` is a static function pointer that takes a pointer to an `environ_entry` structure as an argument and returns a pointer to a character string. This function is used to escape special characters in environment variable values, such as `$`, `` ` ``, `"`, and `\`, which are interpreted by POSIX in double quotes.
- **Use**: This function is used to process and escape environment variable values for safe display or export in shell commands.


---
### cmd_show_environment_entry
- **Type**: `struct cmd_entry`
- **Description**: The `cmd_show_environment_entry` is a constant structure of type `cmd_entry` that defines the command for showing environment variables in the tmux application. It includes the command name, alias, argument specifications, usage instructions, target session details, command flags, and the function to execute the command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to register and define the behavior of the 'show-environment' command within the tmux application, allowing users to view environment variables.


# Functions

---
### cmd_show_environment_escape<!-- {{#callable:cmd_show_environment_escape}} -->
The function `cmd_show_environment_escape` escapes special characters in an environment variable's value for safe use in shell commands.
- **Inputs**:
    - `envent`: A pointer to an `environ_entry` structure containing the environment variable to be escaped.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for the output string, which can be at most twice the size of the input value plus one for the null terminator.
    - Iterate over each character in the input value string.
    - If the character is one of the special characters `$`, `` ` ``, `"`, or `\`, prepend it with a backslash in the output string.
    - Copy the character to the output string.
    - Terminate the output string with a null character.
    - Return the pointer to the escaped string.
- **Output**:
    - A pointer to a newly allocated string containing the escaped version of the input environment variable's value.


---
### cmd_show_environment_print<!-- {{#callable:cmd_show_environment_print}} -->
The function `cmd_show_environment_print` prints environment variables based on specified conditions and formatting options.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command context.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
    - `envent`: A pointer to the `environ_entry` structure representing the environment variable entry to be printed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the command arguments using `cmd_get_args(self)` and store them in `args`.
    - Check if the '-h' flag is not set and the environment entry is hidden; if so, return without printing.
    - Check if the '-h' flag is set and the environment entry is not hidden; if so, return without printing.
    - If the '-s' flag is not set, print the environment variable in the format `name=value` if it has a value, or `-name` if it does not.
    - If the '-s' flag is set and the environment variable has a value, escape the value using [`cmd_show_environment_escape`](#cmd_show_environment_escape), print it in the format `name="escaped_value"; export name;`, and free the escaped string.
    - If the '-s' flag is set and the environment variable does not have a value, print `unset name;`.
- **Output**:
    - The function does not return a value; it outputs formatted environment variable information to the command queue.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmd_show_environment_escape`](#cmd_show_environment_escape)


---
### cmd_show_environment_exec<!-- {{#callable:cmd_show_environment_exec}} -->
The `cmd_show_environment_exec` function displays environment variables for a specified session or globally, handling errors for unknown sessions or variables.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `cmd` structure representing the command being executed.
    - `item`: A pointer to the `cmdq_item` structure representing the command queue item.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve command arguments using `cmd_get_args` and target session using `cmdq_get_target`.
    - Check if a target session flag ('t') is provided and validate the session; return an error if the session is invalid.
    - Determine whether to use the global environment or the session-specific environment based on the presence of the 'g' flag.
    - If a specific environment variable name is provided, search for it in the environment; return an error if not found.
    - If no specific variable is provided, iterate over all environment entries and print each one using [`cmd_show_environment_print`](#cmd_show_environment_print).
    - Return `CMD_RETURN_NORMAL` if successful, or `CMD_RETURN_ERROR` if any errors occur.
- **Output**:
